They are found in the viShNu-bAlI/viShNvarchana mantra of a number kR^iShNayajurvedic gR^ihyaparishiShTha-s: vaikhAnasa, agniveshya and baudhAyana. This suggests that it emerged in a branch of "para"-taittirIyaka-s who were also  early sectarian vaiShNava-s. I say "para" because there is evidence that the vaikhAnasa-s had a now lost brAhmaNa distinct from the other taittirIyaka-s.

Also see R^igvidhAna 3.27.139 onward: keshavam mArgashIrShe tu pauShe nArAyaNam... also from the same temporal layer but from the vaiShNava-s of the RV tradition.

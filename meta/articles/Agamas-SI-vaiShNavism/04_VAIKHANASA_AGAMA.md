+++

The Vaikhanasa Agama describes the method of worshipping Vişņu and prescribes the way of life for those who adopt the Vaikhānasa-sütra. This is based upon the Vedic sources and derives support, for the doctrines which it preaches, solely from Vedic texts The worship of Visnu in the area form is 

stressed 

. 

The word, Vaikhānasa', is very old, occurring in the early literature of Sanskrit It signifies the vanaprasthāṣrama which a student who had completed the study of the Vedas could take up even without getting married 259 The sage, Saubhari, who entered into the householder's life to be happy with a family, though he used to practise meditation, renounced it and entered into the vanaprastha order and followed the way of life prescrib- ed in the Vaikhānasa mode and became a recluse 260 Here the word, 

' vaikhānas a", 15 used In the sense of duties to be

performed by a vanaprastha (who is referred to by the word 'vaikhānasa'). Kalidasa refers to this order of life in the Abhijñānasākuntala 261 The commentator, Srinivāsācārya (Vai- khanasa) refers to the Vaikhānasavrata mentioned here as a hard observance of those who practise penance 262 Here, it must be taken to mean an act of penance and austerity (sramanakadharma). Anyway, the word, ' vaskhānasa, in the above contexts, does not appear to stand for the follower of the Valkhānasa Agama 

The word has been explained as 'belonging to or following Vikhanas, a sage who "dug" within himself and meditated upon God'

Vikbanas himself is the author of Dharma, Grhya and Srauta Sutras which he claimed to have compiled under guidance and instruction from Visņu 274 He is identified with Brahma who is credited with the authorship of the Sutras 275 Besides the ceremonial aspect, these Kalpasütras enjoin the worship of Vişnu 276 The directions given here for the worship are stated to be in consonance with the contents of the Vedas,277 

The Tandya Brahmana,278 Jaiminiya Brahmana,279 Arşeya Brāhmaṇa 280 and Taittiriya Aranyaka 281 mention the name, Vaikhanasa, for reference The Dharmasütras of Baudha- yana,282 the Grhyasülras of Agnivesa 283 and Baudhayana 284 and the Srautasūtras of Baudhayana 285 and Hiranyakesin 288

cite Vikhanas as authority for their ritualistic practice in certain 

contexts. 

Vikhanas had nine pupils according to the following bloka of Bhrgu.287 

«ışaqìsfarûfam afegisfyretocZ | gotu: gorŝa nga nadcunt: 1 

gà fagner: farsar: Stargugarfra: 4 

Among these Kasyapa, Atri, Marici and Bhṛgu are known to have composed their own Agama texts. The works of others have not come down to us Whether they wrote at all is also not known 

Another point to be noted here is that there is no Independent Samhita with the authorship of Vikhanas. Perhaps, Vikhanas taught in general the conduct of man and his mode of life in regard to dharma, grhya and frauta aspects and laid stress on the need to attend to the duties concerning these with impli cit faith in Vispu He could have directed his pupils to write only on the practical aspects of Vaisnavism in the light of his own teachings They too must have undertaken their work accordingly Hence, the Varkhānasa Agamas do not treat exhaustively the Caryāpada which is dealt with in the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtras by Vikhanas himself. 

The validity of the Vaikhānasa Agama is questioned in some quarters The objection here is based on two grounds. The first raises the question of the validity of the Vaikhanasa Kalpa- These sūtras, it is urged, cannot be valld nor their author

acceptable, because they are not adopted by any one outside this group. The second criticism is based on the vocation of those who adopt them. The priest who attends to the worship of the idol according to the Vaikhānasa-sūtras, must be consi- dered to live upon the earnings through this The Vaikhānasa Agama has not prescribed any vocation other than attending to the worship of the Deity for those who follow these sutras. Such priests are called devalakas288 and, along with others whose practices are similar, they have received severe condemnation. They are stigmatised as not being Brahmins They are com. pared to Candalas

Vedas for any rite whatsoever. That they do not adopt any other kalpasūtras is not merely a meaningless contention, but also speaks highly of their original and superior position among kalpasūtras The sutras of Apastamba, Gautama, Yama, Manu, Samkha, Likhita, Härita, Vasistha and others adopt the sütras of Vikhenas for the reception and preservation of the sacred fire (kunda), while performing Paundrika and other sacrifices 289 Vişņu alone is to be worshipped according to these sutras, which therefore should be considered as sattoika They prescribe their rules in accordance with the duties of castes and orders in life The Vaikhanasa Agamas must not therefore be denied validity, merely because they deal with matters according to the Varkhanasa Kalpasūtras 

Those who have been adopting these sutras to guide their religious practices, have been studying the Vedas through the generations and gone through all the secular and religious purificatory rites (samskāra) enjoined therein. They have been following the rules prescribed for castes and orders in life. They are diligent in doing the duties prescribed for them. They are Brahmins devoted only to God Therefore, they are not inferior to any other group of the Hindu community 

Those who follow the Vaikhānasa Agama the texts of which are composed by Kasyapa, Atri and others, are required, by virtue of following the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra, to perform worship to God in arcă form This work is not prompted by the need to earn their living On the other hand, they would become degraded, if they do not discharge this duty. So the definition of * devalaka does not apply to them.

Kasyapa, Atri and other authors of the Varkhanāsa texts are as authoritative as Manu, Narada and others whose Smritis are wholly valid. That these are not included within the well known subjects of learning 290 (vidyāsthāna) is no argument, since their number (fourteen) only implies that some more could be added to this list. All that enlightened and good people believe in could not be traced to this list, and something not found there could not on that account alone be condemned,291 

Other Dharmajāstra texts do not expatiate on the celebration of festivals, but the Varkhanasa Agamas have an elaborate treatment of them. This is no reason to declare the latter's invalidity Like some Dhar nasastra texts,292 the Vatkhānasa Sutras recognize the worship of God. Both just indicate the mode of worship Or this is based the detailed treatment of this subject in the l'arkhanasa Āgamas The elaboration is not

therefore lacking in authority and the Agamas do not cease to be valid because of this 

Finally, it must be said that the Mahabharata mentions both the Varkhanasa and the Pancaratra as equally valid.

The Vaikhānasa Agama is ancient, as it is mostly free from the influence of the tantrika practices. The Vaisnavadharma. parvan293 in the Asvamedhika-parvan of the Mahabharata, where this is mentioned, is not admitted by modern scholars to be earlier to the nuclear portion of the epic Anyway, the cult of 

Vaikhanasa must be as old as Pāñcarātra The account of the Páñcarātra doctrine is put into the mouth of Bhisma whose dis- courses are contained in the Santiparvan of the epic.294 Bhişma died before the beginning of Kaliyuga (3101 B,C), and so the doctrines of the Vaikhānasa and Pâñcarātra are as old as the date of the epic which is fixed about 3000 B.C. when it was narrated to Janamejaya by Vyasa's pupil, Vaišampāyana 

That this Agama was also known as Bhagavata is evident from the references which the commentators 295 on the Kalpa.

Baga, describing Divakaramitra, the Buddhist monk, in the Harşacarita, says :

Harsacarita-N S Press, Bombay, pp 238-239. 

It is here said that the Buddhist monk was attended by a num- ber of people who became his disciples. They were the followers of various systems of faith and thought Here the words, bhagavata,' ' aupanisada,' ' aisvarakāranıka', 'paurāṇika and 'pañcaratrika' occur to mean respectively the devotees of Vişņu, followers of the Upanisads, the Nayayikas, preachers of the Puranas and the followers of the Pañcarātra system. Those who followed the Upanisads, Nyaya system and Purānas could be taken to have faith in Vispu and other deities as well The devotees of Visnu and the followers of the Pañcaratra system are exclusivety attached to Visņu. The word 'Bhagavan' denotes primarily Visnu288 and no other deity, and the words 'Pañcarat- *rika" and Bhāgavata' must be taken to mean two groups of

devotees of Vişnu. Hence the Bhagavatas must be different from the followers of the Pañcaratra. They should be the worshippers of the Lord described as 'Bhagavan in the Visnupurana and Bhagavadgita. Or they may be the Vaikhanasas. This identifi. cation requires stronger evidence, If it is admitted, the Vaikhanasa system may be taken to have been in vogue at the beginning of the 7th century AD 

The Avantisundari of Dandin (c. 675 A D.) refers to the worship of the Vaikhanasa kind in the following passage: 

gà a fagnafaarafafgà faut curaef¶àg 

प्रज्वलत्सु प्रदीपेषु । 

This gives the latter half of the seventh century as a period during which the rites according to the system of Vikhanas were being observed 297 

The Vaikhanasa Agamas are mainly concerned with worship of the Lord in a concrete form. To that end are detalled the selection of a site, building of the temple, choosing materials like wood and stone, production of the idols of various kinds, their installation, method of worship, private and public festivals, and expiation for the sins of omission and commission. Apart from Visou, other deities like Rudra, Siva, Devi, Vinayaka, Şanmukha, Sürya etc., are required to be worshipped,298 The reason given for the worship of Rudra is interesting

Many other ways are available for offering worship to God like Pāñcarātra, Toga and others. Yet, the Vaikhanasa mode is said to be the best and most pleasing to God.299 In this connection, the following passage is of significance

The expression, 'visistädvaita-pūjana', must be taken to be the way of worshipping God in accordance with the doctrines of the Visiștadvaita system The word, višistādvaita', came to be used to refer to the system of Vedanta expounded by Ramanuja only during the 13th century 300 This passage must have been added to the Airssaṁhità after this period. Yet one cannot miss the desire behind this addition to the text It is to harmonise the mode of worship taught by Vikhanas with the doctrines of the Visistadvaita system 

Regarding the installation of the Idols and the need to worship, a question is generally raised. The Lord is everywhere, Why should there be invocation (āvahana) and dismissal (visarjana) of the Deity? The answer is given thus in the Varkhānasa Agama The Lord is all-pervasive. Invocation means inviting Him through mantras and requesting Him to be in one particular place to receive worship 

Otherwise, even gods

cannot adore Him. While He is invoked, He compresses His expansive form out of kindness for His devotees, just as the peacock does its tail-plumes Visņu shines in the heart of the devotee who meditates upon Him as the fire in the forest blazes forth in a particular place there 301 The words of Märkandeya, which are cited here, are worth noting :

Knowledge of the Ultimate Reality is admitted by all the schools of thought as the means of obtaining freedom from bondage. The Reality must be known as it is, without there being any room for uncertainty or delusion Such knowledge is called tattoajñāna, Reality, which is referred to by the word, ★ tattva, is taken differently by different schools of thought. The Visistadvaita school recognizes three tattoas, namely, cit (sentient) acit (insentient) and Isvara (God) The Varkhanasa Agama offers a very direct interpretation The Vedas declare Nārāyaṇa to be the Supreme Tatloa So the word 'tat must be 

taken to refer to Vişnu The Paramatman is the object of tattoajñāna, the individual self is the knower and the Vedas represent the knowledge of tattvajñāna

As it is very subtle, its nature could not be determined. Hence some Vedantins303 declare it as both existence and non-existence (sadasal) He is the self of all.

Prakyti is both sentient and insentient.314 The former is the self which is ever associated with a material body and gets affected by it as a result of the deeds done by it before getting into it. The self migrates from body to body and suffers the results of its deeds. Insentient prakṛt is represented by the products of matter such as the five elements, mind, senses and other such things. The process of creation is stated to be due to God's will, but is not described as such, 315 

There is a glorious description of Vispu who pervades the entire world and remains there as its inner controller. The universe is conceived as His body, several things in the created world becoming the limbs.

The description317 of the human body, as possessed of the cakra of twelve spokes, the Kundalini sakta, various ducts ( nādi ), and the cakras made of them, along with the names of twelve ' nerves' like pungala, susumnā, add and others, reveal that the Vaikhanasa Agama belongs to the yoga tradition. There is a detailed account of the practice of yoga318 which is required for self-control, Deep meditation is needed to visualize God who occupies the heart of the self.

The japa of this mantra thrice a day is declared to yield manifold benefits commencing from long life and ending with final release,322 

Before explaining the process of meditation, the nature of the human body, its protection, development and attributes are set forth 323 The three qualities, sattva, rajas and tamas, are then described with reference to their features and the effects they produce in human beings.324 As long as the self is encased in the physical body, there are three states of consciousness through which it gets experience, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep The state of transcendence is also attainable.325

Vasudeva shines in the upturned lotus at the top of the suşumnā nāḍī, 321 Vişnu who is present in the heart must be meditated upon.328 

The ducts (nadi) are stated to be 72,000 in number, of when ida, pingală, suṣumna and eleven others are prominent. The first three of these play an important role in man's contem- plation and, even there, the susmund is held to be the path for obtaining final release. These fourteen are spread over the body. Besides the five vital airs (prāna and others), there are five more with the names of näga, kūrma, kṛkara, devadatta and dhanañ- jaya 329 Among them, prāṇa rests between mouth and nose, be- tween heart and navel, and between the two great toes; apāna in the navel (1.e, in excretory and generative organs), vyāna in the joints, udana in the throat, samāna all through the body, nāga in the throat, kurma in the eyes, kpkara in the stomach, devadatta throughout the body and dhanañjaya all over the body,330 

Although japa, homa, arcana and dhyana are declared to be the four courses for pleasing God, the Varkhānasa Agama stresses the significance of arcana which will accomplish all that one likes to achieve.

Among the eight constituents of yoga, yama is said to be of ten kinds, of which the first two are identical with those given by Patanjali 331 Asteya is referred to by the word, acaurya " Brahmacarya is stated to be the householder's attachment to his wife and, as such, means making no advances to other women. The other six which are stated here are dayā, ārjava, kṣāni, dhairya, mitäs ina and sauca Niyama is are of ten kinds, of which tapar and santoga agree with the enumeration by Pitaf- jul: 332 

Others are astıkya, däna, Vişnupūia Vedärthasravaṇa, kutsitakarmasu laya, gurupa desasraddhā, mantrābhyasa and homa The use of the word, Visnu, brings out the identity of the God- head The seventh is an explanation of hri, and the next shows the importance attached to the role played by the preceptor. The twentyfour divisions of yama aod nyama make an aspirant fit for understanding meditative practices.333 

Nine kinds of postures are enumerated with a description for each and a classification of them as the best, mediocre and ordinary 334 Präṇāyāma gets a very detailed description in which it is shown bow the vital airs are to be made to pass through the nāḍis. This purifies the nādis and enables the aspirant to bave the lotus of the heart spread out so as to make hi see Narayana there.335

Pratyāhāra is of five kinds. The senses are withdrawn from their objects The aspirant finds everything to be like himself The vital airs are made to fill up the eighteen vulnerable spots in the body and thereby maintain complete cessation of external activity 336 Dharana is of eight kinds, namely, fixing up stead. fastly the mind, control of ākāśa both within and without, control of the five elements and keeping the blissful body of God in the heart 337 

Dhyana is of two kinds, according as the nışkala and sakala forms of God are meditated upon The former is not available even to the gods and the latter is of the nirguṇa and saguna kınds. Through meditation the aspirant visualizes God as having supreme bliss for His form 338 Meditating upon God as the store of auspicious qualities, Yajñamürti, Visqu and Narayana, is of the latter kind with four subgroups having one for each of these forms 339 Samadhi is deep contemplation 10 which the self and God are in the same plane As a stone that is not hot becomes heated by the sun's heat, the self acquires a flawless and blissful nature on visualizing God and continues to experience Nārāyana As long as such a self remains in this world, it gets all kinds of siddhis and is practically released from bondage though embodied (jīvanmukta) 340 This stage of feeling and experiencing the blissful state of final release, while yet alive in this world, is not attainable by any means other than yoga. Sinc. t is said that the self gets ali siddhis, this stage is not the same as in the Advaita system

transcendental (turiya). The effects on mental activities during these are respectively external knowledge, internal consciousness and enlightenment 341 The qualities are dharma, jñāna, aisvarya and vairagya which each of the five deities 

possesses 342 

The state of moksa is one of intimate union of the self with God. 

Vide· 

विष्णोः सायुज्यमाप्नुयात् 

JK. p 30 

That this state should characterize the concept of moksa is justifiable, because the self, which emerges from prakṛtt, that is, Sri ever associated with God, should naturally get back to the place of emergence, of course, with this difference that it returns rid of all residue of karma and with full enlightenment. 

The place to be attained is called Vaikuntha, which, true to its name, cannot be deformed or maimed by any force. It is far above the three called Pramoda, Sammoda and Amoda in the descending order, the last representing the stage wherefrom the regions called Vispuloka begin. Visnu is the deity in Amoda, Mahavisņu in Pramoda, Sadavisņu in Sammoda, and Vyapın who is Narayana in Vaikuntha. The names of the three regions leading to Vaikuntha have significance in the sense that they provide room for the enjoyment of divine bliss 343 

Among the pupils of Vikhanas, four, namely, Atri, Bhrgu, Kasyapa and Marici, gave out their own versions of the Vaikhanasa Agama which they had studied under Vikhanas. Unfortunately, only a portion of each version is now extant.

These texts are written mainly in verse, as in the case of Atri and Bhrgu, but those of Kasyapa and Marici are in prose. All of them reveal a high level of literary attainment 

In their contents, they are similar and, if there is any divergence, it is only in the more elaborate treatment of some topics in one than in another Among the four divisions into which these contents are grouped, it is the kriya pada that has received more attention than others, Carya receiving some treatment The duties of a vanaprastha which are generally known as those of the vaikhānasas, the significant position which Vikhanas held in regard to rituals and the lack of empha- sis on the importance of the ascetic order indicate that the Varkhanasa Agama is ritualistic to the core in its outlook and conception How best the life here could be lived in strict conformity to Vedic traditions and how effectively the Lord could be worshipped have received attention in these works. In fact, the ascetic and the vanaprastha are excluded from officiat- ing as priests for certain rituals 351 The other two divisions of the Agama receive only brief treatment. 

In general, the texts deal with the methods of construction of temples and making images Installation, consecration and worship of the deities receive detailed treatment Special cere- monial baths are described with minute details.

The directions for many an item are drawn from the Sutras of Vikhanas 

All are not entitled to adopt the directions contained in these texts and conduct worship in the temples Only that Brahmin who has had the study of the Vedas and has undergone the consecratory rites (samskäras) since conception, according the rules laid down by Vikhanas in his Kalpasūtras, is competent १० conduct the worship of the Lord in the temples.354 

The Vaskhanasas are exclusive worshippers of Visnu and do this worship as an obligatory duty without expecting any results

AGAMAS AND SOUTH INDIAN VAISNAVISM 

the Vaikhānasa Āgama as such is not well-known in North India. This is perhaps because the Kalpasütras of Vikhanas are followed by a handful of people who belong to the Taittiriya recension of the Krsna Yajurveda which is popular only in South India where the mode of worship in the temples must also have been derived from the Vaikhanasa Agama Most Vaisnava temples in the south are at present governed by the Varkhanasa tradition. Perhaps, these texts were more popular among the Tamilians Words of Tamil origin are found in some texts 361 

The Samürtärcanadhikarana, which forms part of the Atrisamhita, has 83 chapters containing about 5,000 slokas Twentyfive chapters of this work are concerned with architectural details and eleven with the rites of expiation (83rd) is devoted to the worship of the sur

gotra and pravara of 47 separate chapter (63rd) 

The printed text has an Appen iix I containing six chapters representing a version based on a diff rent manuscript Bhrgu, Kasyapa, Angirasa and Atri received teaching about the highest dharma, the Supreme Deity and the method of worship from the four faces of Brahma respecavely facing the east, south, west and north quarters 363 While mentioning the various branches of learning, those of the Buddhists and Jains are also

included.364 The Agamas are said to be five, namely, Vaikhānasa, Sattvata, Tirtha, Aikantika and Muzaka 365 The Lord uttered some expressions taking Himself the form of a bird, and Brahma who searched for the meaning of those expressions is here known as Vikhanas. The system which Vikhanas expound- ed became divided into four groups connected with the names of Atri, Bhrgu, Marici and Kasyapa. The Sattvata mode is based on the Ekayana Veda 366 The Tirtha kind has 24 tantras and prescribes four kinds of initiation (diksā). It has four divisions, jñāna, yoga, krıya and caryā as in other Agamas, and an addition- al section on prāyaścitta 387 The other two are not treated, except for the mention of their names The subject matter in all these five is stated to be one and the same 368 The Vyuhas are stated to be five in the Vaikhānasa system and four in the Pañcaratra The pranava represents the threefold vyü ha 389 Mention is made of the six infirmiues (urmı),370 namely, grief, illusion, hunger, thirst, decay and death, the six sheaths371 (kosa) of skin, flesh, blood, sinew, marrow and bone, and the six phases of existence372 (bhava), namely, taking birth, existing, changing, growing, declining and dying Six paths (adhvā)373 and six relations, namely, para, apara mahān, antarālaka, divya and divyetara,374 which are connected with sound and sense, are also listed

AGAMAS AND SOUTH INDIAN VAISNAVISM 

The name of Sarvasiddhanta is given for 28 kinds. The Pasupata and Tamala are of six and nine kinds respectively.375 The system of the Buddhists, Nyaya and others are then enumer- ated. The names of the texts of the Pañcarātra and those of the four sages of the Vaikhānasa are given For the latter together the number of slokas is stated to be 64,000 and the number of texts as twentyfive 376 The nature of reality and the eight- limbed yoga get treated in the next two chapters 

377 

There is the Appendix II which deals with the nature and geography of the world and has only one chapter called Bhuvanakosavarnana as taken from Atri's Visnutantra At the end of the printed text, there is a chapter numbered as eight, belonging to Airi's authorship and entitled Durnaksatraprāyas- cittavidhi 

The information contained in two appendices is very useful, Yet the mention of adhva, which is generally treated in the other Agamas, Säkta, Sawa and Pañcarātra, does not establish it to be a genuine doctrine held by the Varkhanasa system 

Among the texts of Bhrgu, the Kriyadhikara has 39 chapters containing about 4000 slokas Worship of God is of three kinds" in the mind, in the image and in the sacred fire The first kind must not be taken as meditation, but as offering worship in all its details mentally conceived The second is carried out with 

respect to the idol which is installed 

The third kind consists 

in mentally conceiving God as seated amidst the sacred fire and making offerings to Him in that fire.378 The worship of the idol Is the best among the three 379

YAIKHANASA AGAMAS 

Expiatory rites are dealt with in five chapters. It is also shown how to get over minor lapses during worship without undertaking an elaborate expiatory process. There are references to the treatment of the topic in the context in the Tajnadhikara,380 Niruktadhikara381 and Khilädhikara 382 The opinion of Angiras is cited more than once 383 

Bbṛgu's rajñādhikāra contains 51 chapters, of which explatory rites cover SIX. The main subject-matter is the worship of God according to the directions contained in the Vaikhanasa system The Prakirnadhikara of Bhrgu is a supple- ment to Marici's Vimānārcanakalpa and Atri's Samūrtärcanā dhi, karana 

The greatness of the Vaikhānasa system, offences (apacāra) and the nature of sin are treated here. Some of the slokas in the last chapter are identical with some in the Manusmpts, Bhrgu is mentioned as the propounder of the doctrines of the Manusmrti. He may be perhaps identical with this Bhrgu. Six chapters of this Prakirṇādhikāra are devoted to expiatory rites. The Khiladhikāra of Bhrgu has three sections called jnana, kriya and yoga, dealing respectively with the tattrajñāna, practice of worship and meditation on God, 

It contains 24,000 slokas in 37 chapters 

Kasyapa's Jñänakända is in prose and contains 108 chapters. While recommending the worship of the idol, it is said that here the eyes and mind get delighted through such worship and perfect remembrance of God becomes possible. This gives rise to devotion and faith He who has faith and devotion has complete success in all endeavours 384 There is mention of nine kinds of regions named Vaışgava, Brahma, Raudra, Aindra,

Garuda, Bhautika, Asura, Raksasa and Paisaca. Only the first is to be chosen for the erection' of a temple.385 How the villages and towns are to be formed is detailed in four chapters (14-17) The person who is devoted to God; must set apart one third of his property for the maintenance of his family and spend the remainder for building a temple and maintaining it 386 

Among the five forms the unchanging and highest one is Brahman called Vişnu His form is characterized by bare existence and is subtie. He is then partless The question that would rise then is regarding the forms of Satya, Acyuta, Puruşa and Aniruddha, It is said that these are only the created forms of Visņu, like the shape of the written characters (tipt) The characters are only the symbols of various sounds 387 Close union of the self with God marks the stage of moksa 388 Twelve chapters are devoted to expiatory rites 

Marici's Vimānārcanakalpa, which is written in prose, has 101 chapters of which 40 are devoted to the construction of temples, six to the daily worship, three to the bath, eleven to she conduct of festivals and installation of other idols, nineteen to the acts of expiation, one to the deities in charge of the holy fire-pit (agnikunḍa), four to the code of practices, fourteen to tattva and one to the extent of the Vaikhānasa texts 

The text opens with two stanzas of benediction in honour of God as Srinivasa who gets a glorious description Marici is the narrator of this text. At the outset he speaks of the means of getting final release God (Nārāyaṇa) must be worshipped with the mantras taken from the four Vedas in a manner pre- scribed by them. Finally, that self which adopts this way of life,

would reach His place,389 Passages from the Rgveda, Taittiriya Aranyaka, Aitareya Brahmana and Taittiriya Upanisad are cited to show that Visnu is the Supreme Being 390 Worship of the Supreme Being (Parama Puruşa) is called 'Vimanäreana',391 which explains the title of the work. 

The results which accrue by this worship are stated to be equal to those of performing Agnihotra even for those who do not do it and all-round prosperity for those who do 392 Marici declares he will set forth the way of doing this worship, which he denotes by the name, Kriyāmargā', suggesting that this text is devoted to the kriya aspect of the Agamas 393 This is evident from the large number of chapters (1-40) devoted to the proced- ural details regarding the construction of the temple and installation of images there. On this account, it is not implied that the carya aspect is not given importance Chapters 41-85 discuss this matter Special mention must be made of the detailed treatment given to the conduct of festival,394 and to the acts of expiation 395 Nineteen chapters which detail the latter, indicate the pro-Vedic character of the Vaikhānasa system

AGAMAS AND SOUTH INDIAN VAISNAVISM 

In particular and of the Agamas in general. Treatment of tattsa, yogic practice and makṣa shows that the jaana and yoga aspects are not ignored in Vaikhānasa Agama,396 

These texts of the four sages lay great stress on the practical side, such as the construction of temples and worship of the idol. Architecture and iconography receive greater attention in the Samurtarcanādhikaraṇa of Atri and the Vimänärcanäkalpa of Marici Whatever be the topic, the Jñänakända of Kasyapa gives a complete and logical treatment. 

This title may seem to be inappropriate to the work of Kasyapa 

For it is not tartvajñāna that receives treatment here. On the other hand, the practical side of the Agama gets elabo- rated, and the word, "jñāna", has relevance to the knowledge of this aspect 

The title thus gets its justification The nature of reality is dealt within this work in a casual manner,397 while Its treatment is more detailed in the work of Marici 

The yoga and carya aspects get brief treatment in the works of Marici and Bhrgu. The works which are lost might perhaps have conveyed more information on the jñāna and yoga aspects 

It is true that Vedic mantras alone are prescribed in these texts for every ritual, In addition, mantras are cited from the Mantraprasna of the Vaikhānasas.

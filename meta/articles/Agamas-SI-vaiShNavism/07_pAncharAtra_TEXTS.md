The Pancarätra doctrines ware preached by five teachers- Sandilya, Aupagayana, Mauñjyāyana, Kausika and Bharadvaja 751 The works of the first and the last, among these, are available, while that of the second gets only reference in some works 752 The other two left no works. The works of the two writers mentioned above, have more than one text with the same name. They treat matters like worship of God, bhakti and prapatti. 

The Narayaniya section of the Mahabharata throws light on the traditions of the Pañcaratra Agama The vyuha doctrine and the daily round of life classified under five heads are the matters treated there The earliest texts must be expected to have dealt with these matters only. On this ground, the texts of the two writers mentioned above could not have been very early The Interlocutors, here, are Aniruddha, Samkars 'na, Bhagavan, Vasudeva, $ 1, Bhrgu, Ahirbudhnya, Nārada, Märkandeya, Sandilya and others. Some of them are said to have received Instructions from others mentioned above, and in their turn, they offered expositions to others It is not therefore possible to fix the priority of any of these texts over others. 

The number of Pañcaratra lexis is listed in some of these works themselves They are 154 in the Visnutantra, 108 in the Padma and Viśvāmitra samhitas, 106 in the Purusottama-samhitā, 103 in the Bhäradvājasamhitā, 100 in the Kapinñjalasamhitā, 91 in the Märkandeyasamhita and 25 in the Hayasirşasamhita and

Mäheŝvaratantra and also in the Agnipurana Schrader's list contains 210 and 14 more of the texts, but the titles of them are not noted,753 The introduction to the Lakṣmitantra 754 enume- rates 225 works, of which 56 end their names in tantra, two In tilaka, one in vaibhava, one in rahasya, one in sambhava and the remaining 10 samhita The Panorama of Pañcarātra literature mentions 289 works, of which 45 end their game in tantra, three in sagara, one in vijñāna, one in purāņa, one in tilaka, one in siddhānta, one in udrovana and the remaining 236 in samhita This work describes 104 works among which 99 end their names in samhita, three in tantra, one in samuccaya and one in cuḍāmani. 

It is presumed that the remaining 186 works are partially lost. Twelve among them have more than one text with the same name The following groups contain redundant names (1) Garudasahitä Tärksyavaṁhita, Vainateyasamhitā and Khageśasamhita, (2) Narasimhākhyalantra and Nikesarisaṁhitä ; and (3) Atrisamhita and Atreyasamhitä Aindratantra, Kama. tantra Dhruvatantra, Panıniyamahatantra Pāvaka、amhitā, Puskala- samhita, Bodhāyanatantra Mahitantra, Māyātantra, Varāhapurāna. samhita, Varā hamıhirasamhitâ, Vaibhavatantra, Sakalasamhita, Sākatayanasamhita, Saivasamh:tä, Sammohanatantra Sankhyatantra, Süryatantra Somatantra and many o bers are purely names connected with certain persons and sages who have distinguished themselves in fields associated with them in order to give them a status in the list. Until information is available about many of these works, it is not possible to decide their exict nature. Besides, among these works, 97 are mentioned only once in the twelve lists, 45 twice and 45 brice. 

The Pañcarātra tex s are classified under three heads, divya, muribhāsila and manusa. The Sattuata, Pauşkara, Jayakhya and others are treated as divyo, as they contain the exposition of

the doctrines by Narayana Himself Those which are the expositions of Brahma and eminent sages are of the second kind, eg, Isvara, Pāramesvara and Bhäradvāja and others. The works written by mortals come under the last head. The Agamas are also classified as sättvika, rājasa and tāmasa The Isvara, Bharadvaja, Saumantava, Paramesvara, Vashāyasa, Citrasikhands and some other sahhitās come under the first head To the rajasa kind belong the Sanatkumāra, Padmodbhava, Sātātība, Tejodravina, Mayasaibhävika and others. The Pancapraśna, Sukaprasna, Tattvasägara and others are of the tāmasa kind 

Generally, an Agama text should contain four divisions called jñāna, voga, Araya and carya Among the texts of the Pancară tra the Palmisamhita contains these divisions Others generally deal with some of these Ta- Brhadbrahma‹amhitā hes four pādas whose exact nature is not stat d The Sandilyasamḥitā has one division called Bhaktıkända-first part, and another called fourth part, 

The Sanatkumārasamhita has four divisions named rätras, named after Brahma, Siva Indra and Rsi It has lost a division called Brhaspatirātra Similarly, there are five divisions called rātra enumerated as first, second and others in the Jñānāmrtasāra The Hayasissasamhita has four kändas with the names, Ādı, Sankarṣana, Linga and Saura 

Among the texts, the Pauskara Jayakhya and Sälivate samhitäs are stared to be the best (ratna) 755 Oth m are based the Paramesvara, Padma and Isvara samhi ́ās According to the Padmasamhita, there are the five best (ratna) tex's, Padma, Sanatkumara Parama, Pädmodbhava, and Mahendra samhitas 756 The Kanvasaṁhitā 757 mentions them to be six in number, with the addition of the Kânavasambilā to the list mentioned above. The Sanatkumārasamhva, how.ver, is here mentioned as the foremost among the samh:tas.

PANCARATKA TEXTS 

247 

The Agamas might have originated in North India, but the texts were developed in South India itself These texts contain references to the kings of Cera, Cola and Pandya regions 753 The adhyayana utsava,759 singing of Goda's compositions,760 Boating festivals 761 and the äzhoars762 find reference in these texts There are even Tamil expressions used in some of these texts 763 Since these works contain references to Nathamuni, Yamuna, Vedāntadesika and the äzhudrs, these must have been composed later than their times 764 The period of the Agamas must be therefore between 800 A D and 1400 A,D However, Utpala (850 A D), Yamuna (10th century) and Rāmānuja (1017- 1137) cite passages from the Pāñcarātra textS Therefore, most important samhitās like Pauskara, Jayäkhya, Sättuata, Išvara, Parama, Sanatkumāra, Ahırbudhnya and others should have been composed before 800 A D 

The Vaikhanase texts have a uniform treatment of the subjeet matter with slight differences among them. In this, they differ from the Pañcaratra works where there is much difference between one text and another. Some trxis deal with theories of cosmogony, leaving aside temple worship, while others concen'rate on temple construction and worship of images. Some describe the principles of yoga in detail while others devote chapters to the means of expiation

composition of a particular text or its priority over another cannot be decided on the strength of its contents For instance, the Ahirbudhnya, Jayakhya and Parama samhitās and the Lakṣmitantra give greater importance to cosmological theories, yantras and other matters. The Sanatkumārasamhita deals with mantras, mudrās, installation of idols, expiatory rites and other such subjects, and contains no reference to temple construction or worship of idols The Pauskara, Pāramesvara, Sattvata, Išvara, Pādma Köpiñjala, Visvaksena, Sriprasna and other texts are more concerned with temple worship. It is hard to decide which matter was treated earlier than others, although it will not be wrong to assume that references to temples point to a later date. 

The Pauskarasamhita sem. 1o be the carliest and the Sattvata- samhita 765 which refers to it must be placed next to it The Jayakhya comes next, followed by the Ahırbudhyasamhita and the Laksmitantra, both of which mention the Sā tivala 768 The Isvara saṁhitā must be placed next, though it mentions the Pauskara, Jaya and Sattvata and also Paramesvara, Padma and Isoara which may be a case of interpolation 767 The Parama, Sanatkumara 768 Paramesvara, Visvaksina and Padma are placed next in this order 769 

criterion lies in that the texts mentioned earlier are cited in the one following them Yet this is not to be taken to help in deciding the priority, as such references to other texis could have been later additions Besides, there are passages in common between some of them, such as (1) the Sattvata. Isvara and Sriprasna and (1) the

Sattuata, Jayakhya and Lakṣmitautra. This order can be admitted only tentatively, for the Padmodbhasa and Kanva samhitās are not available except in fragments The Mahendra-saṁhitä is also not available, but passages from it are cited in the Sanatkumara- samhita,770 Pāramesvara-saṁhstä 771 and Padma-saṁhita 772 

The Pauskara-saṁhitā bas a little less than 6000 stanzas in 43 chapters. The text is incomplete, and some chapters break off n the middle. The Lord, with the name, 'Bhagavin", addresses Brahma as Pauskara' The text mentions the Paramesvara (which is based on it) and also the Sattvata 773 (perhaps included later in the text) The original text must have been composed in North India Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Pravaha, S mha- vaktrakā, Airavati, Gjasthita, Vitas a, Narmada, Drşadvati, Parosni and Sindhu are the rivers mentioned 774 Yamuna 18 said to flow in south-east, Sarasvati in the south and Vitasta in

Airavati is identified with Ravi and Vitasta with Jhelum Drsadvali jins Sarasvati Parosni which is Riv', is identical with Airavati and is only repeated here. Except Narmada, all the above-mentioned rivers flow In north and north-west India The place where this Samhita could have, been composed should be somewhere in north-west Panjab, perbaps near the Himalayas 775

to as Adimurti,785 a name also used in the Paikhānasa Agama to refer to Visqu from whom emerged four deities, Satya, Puruşa, Acyuta and Aniruddha The first kind of caturatmya is that which is the seed for all activities and on account of which the world is of the nature of pure consciousness 786 To the second kind belongs the eternal form which is resplendent like the sun and which has the several colours assumed by the four deities This form gives to the worshippers kaivalya and destroys the Tool-cause which brings about bondage 787 The third kind is obarming like a stream of nectar, having all the materials necessary for creation, maintenance and dissolution The delties take their form and make their appearance and disappear 788 At the command of the fourth kind of caturatmya, the universe is intact 789 God assumes different colours in the yugas 790 

He is also said to have a form called Agnisomiya, made up of letters 791 The Pañcaratra system is called Rahasyamnaya 792 The members of all the four castes are eligible to get initiated for worship 793 and women who are destitutes or miserable can also take part in it.

PĀNCARĀTRA TEXTS 

253 

The Jayakhya-samhitā has about 4500 stanzas in 33 chapters called patalas. This was taught to Narada by Bhagavan. Sandilya recounts what he had heard from Narada. There is an additional section containing 163 stanzas in the first chapter which glorifies the shrine at Kañci and gives details about the festivals, the situation of the shrine and so on, No doubt, it is informative, but it must have been interpolated, since all the manuscrip's of this text do not contain this passage. The samhita describes creation of the pure type and traces the emanation of Acyuta from Bhagavan, of Satya from Acyuta and of Purusa from Satya These three represent the three mani- festations of Vasudeva and are in the form of consciousness. Purusa is also called Ananta and is known as the Supreme Spirit He is the inner ruler (antaryāmin) of all. The divine descents emanate from Him Acyura is of the form of brilliance, Satya has a dazzling body and Purusa has radia ing lustre All these lest in Vasudeva, who is of the form of tranquil consciousness,795 There is diff-ulty in reconciling these three emanations with the three well-ko ɔwa vyū has of the system, because the latter are idenuded by disunci colours which however is not the case here. 

It is equally difficult to take it as representing the Vaikhanasa tradition, for it omits Aniruddha who is admitted as the fifth

delty In it Besides, this tradition takes the order in the reverse way, keeping Purusa at the head. However, the major samh:tās include Satya in the vyuha theory and take all the five as forming a unit with five mantras 796 Or this account must be taken to have been adopted by the Vaisnava Agamas in general, out of which the Vaikhänasa system took them up and added Aniruddha to the list, while the Pañcarātra system developed the vyha theory from the same source. But evidence is wanting to support this position. Anyway, this representation may be taken to give a very early date for this samhitā 

Santika, paustika, vidoeṣana, māraṇa, uccātana and stambhana are cruel rites treated here. By the practice of tantrika rites, khadgasiddhi, añjanāsıddhi, gulıkāsıddhi, rasāyanaııddhi, yaksınī- siddhi and other specific results are achieved 797 This gives a sufficiently early date (about 400 A,D), when belief in such achievements prevailed among the Buddhists 

Brahman is said to have a transcendental form of bliss, all- pervading and flawless, a subtle form with which It remains within the heart of all beings and a gross form with which creation, protection and destruction are carried out. 

It is not generally realised by all people. But, while yet remaining formless, It is realised through meditation 798

PĀNCARĀTRA TEXTS 

255 

Brahman is peerless, beyond the reach of expressions and senses and is to be realised by Himself Without any instrument, He is realised and the means for this is the mantra And mantras are derived from God; they possess shining sounds which Increase in strength through the power of the Lord 801 Each mantra has subtle, gross and transcendental forms 802 

Brahman's mantra form is of two kinds, partless and possessing parts 803 To realise it, knowledge is essential. This Is of two kinds, satta and kriya. The former consists in the knowledge of the existence of Brahman as such. Kriya Is of two kinds, niyama and yama, which mean the rules of discipline and austerities respectively Knowledge of the existence of God could be obtained through yogic methods which again are to be acquired through worship 804 

This Samhita attaches great importance to mantras and their proper use for the equipment of the worshipper. The mode of worship in the temple does not get as much attention as is given in later samhitas Cosmology, the oyiha theory and achleve- ments through tantrika practices which are treated here and are not traceable to any other Päñcaratra text, may well be taken to suggest a very early date. 

The Ahirbudhnya-samhita contains about 3800 stanzas in 60 chapters The text is in the form of an exposition of the doctrines given by Ahırbudhoya, one of the eleven Rudras, to Narada. Durvasas who had known this from Narada, recounts It to Bharadvāja The main purpose of the teaching here is to expound the glory of Sudarsana. The original text is stated

to have contained 240 chapters and was condensed later for easy comprehension,805 

The text opens with a prayer addressed to Visnu in the form of Sudarsana and another to the Saku of Visau The latter is couched in the purely technical terms of the Tantra The text treats of various siddhantas with the help of parakrts and purā kalpa 808 There are ten narrations which illustrate the greatness of Sudarsana and the restoration of the Vedas to Brahma by Visnu thus providing justification for the develop- ment of the Sudardana cul: 807 A very detailed account is given of twentyone kinds of Upavedus, sixty topics of the Sänkhya system, two kinds of yoga, four kinds of Karma-saṁhità, eight parts of the Pasupata system, and ten topics of the Pañcarātra system. The relative worth of these is also evaluated, and the Pañcaratra system is deel red to be the most useful.808 

A sage called Apantara tapaḥ, sprung from the speech of Visnu, and therefore called Vacyāyana, classified the Vedas,809 

Cosmological accounts, Including various kinds of creation and dissolution, are given in four chapters (4-7). A very interesing topic is discussed in this regard Why should there be difference of opinion among thinkers regarding cosmology?

They are explained as arising on the following grounds Firstly, man's speech is not adequate to bring out the truth, Secondly, people mistake one word for another in certain contexts and do not know what synonyms are Then, limitations of powers of comprehension make it difficult to understand certain things. and one cannot speak about what one could not know. Finally, the aspects of God are infinite, and only one of them is grasped by one philosopher and another by another philosopher and so 00.810 

Brahman is described as characterised by unlimited bliss, having no beginning and no end. It is Identical with Narayana, It resides in every being, pervades every thing, is faultless and undisturbed like the waveless sea It bag po tinge of material qualities and is the abode of non-material qualities. It has no limitations due to space, time and objects, It is ever full, ever manifest (nilyedita), and cannot be guessed to be of this or that kind or size,811 The four vyuha deitias (Căturăimya) are said to be of three kinds in their collective nature on grounds of their pervasion (vyāpti), the manifestation of the respective qualities (gunenmeșa) and personal figures 812 

The self has no beginning, Is Indeterminable blissful, divine (bhagavanmaya), filled, as it were, by the Lord and ever existing under His control It represents an infinitesimal fraction of the Sakil of God 813 It is only those selves that receive God's grace (called Saktipata) that Can prosper and get freed from bondage.814 The self is then rid of the aspects of the effects of Its good and bad deeds. Detachment dawns upon it, leading

to discriminative knowledge. The self now gets Interested in knowing some means for its future welfare. It takes to the study of the texts, approaches the preceptor and gets enlighten- ment through his favour Knowledge of reality, yogic practice, performance of good deeds, resorting to observances and such other activities lead the self to the place of Visņu,815 

This samhita is unique and differs much from later texts in its contents. One half of the text is devoted to occultism In theory and practice Philosophy is mainly dealt with in chapters 1 to 14 and incidentally treated In all the remaining chapters; It may be taken to cover one fourth of the work Initiation, social rules, and yoĝa occupy six chapters, 

The remaining chapters give a very brief account of the installation ef images. Even here the practical aspect of the magical figures (yantras) dominates, particularly with reference to Sudarsana. Public festivals (ulsavas) are not at all mentioned The doctrine of self-surrender (nyāsa) is treated in ch. 37 

These aspects of the contents reveal one significant trait of the early phase of the development of the Pañcarātra tradition Here it is sought to provide a philosophical background for the doctrines as they were taught by God to Närada The worship of the Lord was then intended to be carried through mantras and yantras. There is little reference in this text to temples, their construction and worship of idels, all of which should have found a place within the practical side of the Agama only long afterwards at a time when worshippers could not have found it easy to worship the Lord through mantras and meditation. The Pauşkara, Sättuata and Jaya samhitas 816 contain a brief treatment of idol worship. Among these, the second and third are

A resume of the contents of the samhita completes this chapter. Kashmir appears to have been the place of origin of this samhita on the following grounds, stated by Schrader Birch bark which grows in Kashmir and the Himalayas, is stated to be used as a sheet for the drawing of a diagram (yantra) 825 The aspirant who gets initiated according to the tradition, becomes rid of all sins like the sun which gets freed from the obstruction caused to its brilliance by snow, a comparison which points to a region in Kashmir or the Himalayas 826 The reference to King Mukta,ida of Kashmir (c. 750 AD) in Chapter 48 confirms the place of the rise of the text in that region, 

Since Utpala (850 AD) cites a passage in his Spandapradīpikā which resembles one in the Ahirbudhnya saṁhila,827 the date of the work can be fixed before 850 A D, perhaps in the eighth century The Kashmir origin of the work and Utpala being a native of Kashmir str.ngthen the identification of the passage cited by him 

The Laksmi tantra contains 4000 stanzas in 57 chapters, of which the last seven are not included in all the manuscripts on which the printed text is based. The work is in the form of a discourse given by S.1 to Indra. Narada gives a version of this to the sages assembled in the Malaya hills The colophon at the end of every chapter refers to the text as Pāñcarātrasāra, perhaps as a summary of a larger original which however is said to have contained 100 crores of stanzas 828 

Though the text is not divided into sections which are expected of an Agama work, it is found that philosophy as forming part of jñana is dealt with in about a third part,

consisting of the first seventeen chapters. The sclence of occultism takes up nearly twenty chapters Yoga has a brief treament. Chapters 37, 41 and 53 deal with kriya. It is found thus that philosophy and occultism (carya) have received predominant attention in this text. 

One noteworthy feature of this work is that the female principle, sakti, is demonstrated to be responsible for all that takes place as creation, maintenance and destruction, keeping Visqu in the background. Yet it is sought to be proved that only at the will of Visnu, Sri becomes active He is perfectly tranquil, changeless and eternal, and thus He is in the back- ground. As a philosophical principle, Śri occupies a status equal to that of Visnu. She is thus an integral part of Vişnu 

The 

Creation is detailed in three ways. The first method is split into three classes, namely, pure, mixed and impure pure type is a transcendental one which includes the oyuha emanations The second type is mixed: It refers to the creation made by Brahma; and the impure kind follows the Säńkıya theory of evolution 329 The second method is based on the principle of stages called kosas 830 The third method is based on the emanation of sound stages called adhuan 831 to play in this Agama with the worship of the deity 

from Brahman and is divided into tx This method has a very important role It seeks to relate the power of mantras 

The contribution made by this samhita to cosmology is Indeed high, for in no other Pañcarātra text creation receives such systematic treatment The principles underlying the concepts of six kosas and six adhoans are essential to explain two

facts.

Matter and selves are eternal.

Where do they rest prior 

to creation? They have to be in some place undisturbed during the period of deluge. The Agama tradition admits the principle of kosa to explain the emergence of matter and self, kosa itself marking the stage which represents the projection of sekti The concept of creation of sound becomes meaningful through its rise from Brahman. Being an emanation from a subtle stage, the gross sound can easily Indicate its source. God is often depicted as having mantra as His body. The worship of God through the ulterance of mantras, which are made up of sounds in specific collocations, becomes therefore understandable When sounds are uttered, they find a reflex and reciprocity lo God 

The Pancaratra system deserves credit for the way in which It makes all the three methods of creation supplement one another The bearing of each on the others explains how the ryuha deities and idols which belong to pure creation, could be worshipped by the selves who emerge from the kofa and use the mantras which represent sonic creation. Some of the samhitas have references to the kosa and adhvan creations in the develop. ment of the docinines, of course mention being made of the various stages only as and when the occasion demands them.832 

The Supreme Being is a unity in duality He is ever with Saki He is called by several names such as Paramaiman, Vasudeva Narayana and others He is not differentiated from Sakti and so is said to be non-dual (advaita) 833 He is called Srinivasa, while appearing in the medication of the self without any disturbance 834

This is called sygti. Its attachment to those objects la sthitl. Attachment to a particular object is discarded by the self when It takes to another, and this is called samhara. Tirobhava is the formation of Impressions created by that object and anugraha is the removal of that Impression. These are the five functions of the self which is part of Sakil and correspond to the five functions of Sakti with the same names Through the grace (sāktspāla) 841 of Sakti, the self discards its limitations and becomes omniscient and omnipotent The waking, dream and deep sleep states really belong to matter. The transcendental state does not really belong to the self, because it consists of pure non-material sattva 842 

The self is required to get freedom from bondage, to pursue the path of karma which would please Sakti which grants enlightenment. Knowledge of Reality is then acquired by following the path of jñana. By pursuing the path of yoga as the next step, the self gets freed from all limitations and it becomes one with Lakṣmi-narayana 843 Nyasa is recommended as an alternative and easier means of getting moksa,844 

Like the Ahirbudhnyasaṁhitā, this text also is free from reference to Idols and idol-worship la temples. The theories of creation get a detailed treatment. Sakti's greatness is stressed In every part of the work. The descents of Laksmi and Her emanations are covered in three full chapters, 4, 8 and 9.

Some Indications are there to suggest Kashmir as the home of this Tantra also. One is the recommendation that birch bark be used for inscribing the mantra of Laksmi 851 Nyasa,852 the doctrine of self-surrender, is treated as in the Ahirbudhnya. samhita. These two are the only two ancient texts which deal with this doctrine. Grant of divine.grace is referred to as S'aktipäta in both,853 This expression occurs also in the Sawa Agamas 854 of Kashmir. It must be admitted that Vaisnavısm flourished in Kashmir along with Saivism. The Agamas of both these could have had a common source and also influenced each other. In these circumstances, both these texts could have bad their origin in Kashmir. 

The Pauskara-samhita, 100, which refers to some geographical surroundings through mentioning rivers, can have risen in Kashmir. Likewise, the Jayakhya which refers to many cruel practices could have also taken its rise in Kashmir. So, it might not be wrong to astume that all these early samhitas of the Pancaratra could have had Kashmir as their 

home. 

The Laksmi tantra mentions the Sattvata-samhita twice 855 If the reference in the Ahirbudhnya-samhita of the 8th century to the exposition of the Srisūkta can be taken to mean this text, then this must be placed before that date,

In the latter case, the Vaikhānasa method is followed here, except for pulting Ananta in the place of Aniruddha.861

This samhita discusses many matters like idol worship in temples, the installation of the idols and conducting festivals. Srirangam, Yadavādri and Kañch are stated to be important places863 where the Pañcaratra mode of worship is adopted. There is a separate chapter describing the glory of Yadavadri, Sanatkumara is said to have brought Nārāyapa to this bill which therefore came to be called as Narayanadri and worshipped Him according to the Saltvata mode. Rama is said to have worshipped Him at Ayodhya and hence He is known as Ramapriya, It is said that Balarama and Kṛṣṇa brought Ramapriya to Yadavādri and celebrated the festivals after installing Him there 864

The Installation of idols and the method of worshipping them receive treatment, but there is no reference to the construction of temples and aspects of worship there On the other hand, cosmology, yogic practices and such other matters are treated briefly. 

Three methods 865 are described for worshipping God. Worship through mantras is stated to be karmayajña, japa of the mantras and slotras constitute vakya-yajña and mental worship of God is manoyajna 

Nothing is said to be more beneficial than offering worship at the feet of Hari.

It le difficult to belleve in this, for even if the lost Brhaspalirätra was longer (ban any other section, the total number would not come up to so much. Or, It must be supposed that several stanzas were lost even in some of the chapters available in print.

Karma, jñāna and yoga are enjoined as the paths to be taken up one after another in this order for obtaining salvation. Worship of the Idol is recommended while pursuing the first two ways. While practising yoga, the aspirant will have spiritual experiences in dreams, in his own body, in the inner effulgent self, in his mind and sense-organs 891 He realises close onion (sayujya) with Visnu 892 while practising yoga,

To adopt any of these paths, it is necessary to worship God. By worthipping Mahavisņu, through yoga, one becomes fit to adopt karmayoga. Sadavisņu b comes pleased with this karma and makes the aspirant fit to adopt jñanayoga Thereupon yogic practice bongs about the final release of the aspirant. The proper place, time and kind of penance one is required to undertake are also described 893 

Those who worship Visnu with the three mastras get, after death, a form like that of Visnu and are also called Visņu. Such persons are given various regions to occupy where they get different names which are enumerated in Indraratra, chapter 6. Some of these are identical with those found in the Vispu sahasranama 

The regions which they occupy are described in the next chapter Curiously enough, there is no reference here to Vaikuntha. Puruşa, Satya, Acyuta and Aniruddha are mentioned as worshipping Sadāvışnu 894 

Letters which make up the mantras 895 are enumerated together with their presiding deitles. The basic letters and their evolutes are treated in such a way as to throw light on the linguistic aspect 890 of the mantras. Perhaps, a study of them

The unique concept of the Supreme Reality, the development of the vyuha theory, the role assigned to the mantras, the practical side of tantra which includs the use of mudrā, manḍala and nyasa and the treatment of the routine life of the followers of the Pañcarātra tradition in the Brahmarātra give an individual stamp to this text, a feature not to be noticed in any other samhita. The lost portions in the Brahmaratra 910 and the whole of the Brhaspati-rätra must have contalned Important detalls on the doctrines and practices of the Pañcarātra system.

This chapter which is now available contains an account of the development of the Pañcaratra system 912 through several stages, much in the same way as in the Nārāyaniya section of the Mahabharata. The promulgators of the doctrines are named as in the Iŝvara samhitã Sandilya is stated to have taught the doctrines to Sumantu, Jaimini, Bhṛgu, Aupagayana and Mauñjyayana 913 Nara and Nārāyana are stated to practise the Sattvatadharma in Badarikāśrama for the well being of the world 914 This

Why this text should be described as ancient in the Pauskara-samhita 916 on which it is held to be based, Is puzzling. Perhaps such references were interpolated at a later date. Many of the ancient and important samhitas917 like the Pauşkara, Sattvata, Jayakhyā, and others are mentioned. Besides, there are passages918 here identical with those in the Pauskara. Rāmānuja (1017-1137 A D) is the earllest to cite passages from this text which must give it a date prior to 1000 A.D.

Chapter 27 is in both prose and verse, The entire work deals only with the kriya and carya aspects. 

There must have been either another text with the title * Visvaksena-samhita' or another section which dealt with the jñāna and yoga portions. This is evident from the citations made from this work by Pillal Lokacārya, Vedantadefika and Manavala-mahanuni in their works The last-mentioned teacher made full use of this samhita in his commentary on the Tattvatraya of Pillal Lokācārya This secilon Is not now available From the citations It appears that this text contained God's discourse to Visvaksena

Another group of five on this basis is made up of Para Vasudeva who is ever manifest (nityodita) and the four Vyuha deities periodically manifest (sāntodita). Another grouping is according to the four stages of waking, dream, deep sleep and the transcendental consciousness presided over by Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarsana and Vasudeva respectively 921 Sankarsana teaches the Vedas and the Pañcarātra Pradyumna introduces all religious rites which are to be performed.

AGAMAS AND SOUTH INDIAN VAISNAVISM 

practiees and linguistic occultism do not get much attention In some of these works. In the treatment of the subjects, between one text and another there is not much difference. 

Much Importance cannot be attached to the enumeration of the names of samhitas in some of the texts. For example, in the Pādma, Märkandeya and Hayasīrșa saṁhitās and the Visnutantrą their own names bead the lists. On the other hand, the Kapiñjala, Pāramešvara, Bhāradvāja and Viśvāmitra seṁhitās and the Mahendra tantra mention the name of a samhita other than their own at the head of these lists Firstly, there is no evidence to show that the order in which the texts are enumerated was the same lo which they were composed If the order was meant to declare the precedence of one over another, then all the lists should reveal uniformity in their enumeration, Secondly, there is no evidence also to show that this enumeration of the texts was not interpolated subsequent to the composition of the works in which they get mentioned Thirdly, such lists as those in the Padma, Märkandeya and other samhitas commence with their own names as beading those lists, perhaps to lay emphasis on themselves as more important than those whose names are enumerated there Lastly, reliance must be placed on other pieces of evidence such as references made in one text to others, like the Ahirbudhnya-saṁhitā and Lakṣmitantra referring to the Sattvata and Jayakhya. Significance must also be attached to the mention of some texts as great. Until more information is available regarding the contents of the samhitās now preserved only in manuscripts, It will not be practicable to have an estimate of their contributioa Besides, the texts that have been mentioned here are the most important ones which the leading exponents of Vaisnavism have chosen to cite in support of various topics.

The Agamas advocate the adoration of particular deitles to the exclusion of others who form part of the retinue of the principal deity. More than one deity enjoys the privilege of such prominence The Valspava, Sakta, Saiva, Ganapatya, Svayambhuva and Candra are most well known kinds glorifying particular deities. The Pasupata, Kālāmukha, Cina and Jaina are also held to be types of Ågamas, The Saura also is added to the list Of these, Pasupata and Kalamukha are to be brought under Saiva, and Cina and Jaina are of the nastika kind. Sakti (standing for the female principle identified with Durgā or Pārvati), Siva, Ganapatı (Vinayaka), Brahma, Candra and Surya are the principal deities glorified. In course of time, all of them have become extinct, except those of the Sakta, Saiva and Vaispava varieties 

Visņu, 

Among modern scholars who have been making an intensive study of the Agamas, there is a tendency to treat the Sakta Agamas as the earliest among the Tantras and as influencing the development of other Agamas, though not their origin While arriving at this conclusion, the role played by Sakti in the other Agamas is stressed All the three Agamas, Säkta. Saiva and Vaisnava, agree that Sakti plays a prominent role. While Sakti Is the prominent deity in the Sakta Agamas, the other two recognize Sakti as never dissociated from Siva or Visqu The question is one of the position occupied by Sakti Whether she has an independent or dependent status, the fact remains that she has to play a significant role To arrive at this conclu- sion, there is no need to look upon the dependent nature of Sakti as derived from her status. Every Vedic deity is looked

upon as possessing power, which is ever with that delty. This Concept is inherited by the Saiva and Vaisnava Agamas. This does not mean that the Sakta Agama should have been the earliest in origin Mutual influences should have been there. All the Agamas must have had a common source, but their development need not have not been uniform in point of time. 

The Sakta system believes in the all-embracing potency and supremacy of Siku, treated as a female principle Sakti is considered as a goddess and hunce this Agama is called also as the Devi Agima It is held that Sakti worship was introduced from Persia 158 Others believe it to have risen in Bengal and N-pl, Tibet and China,156 Sakti is God in mother-form In her static, transcendent aspect, she is of the same nat re av St 1.

The texts of this Agama speak of the system as delivered by Devi, listened to by Siva and approved by Vasudeva (1.e., Krsna treated as the brother of Devi) Sometimes, Devi listens to the discourse of Siva The derivation of the word · Âgama', is therefore given as rising (a) from Siva or Devi, reaching Devi or Siva (ga) and approved (ma or mata) by Vasudeva 158 They are classified as daksına based on the Vedas, Smrts and Purāņas · vama, relying on the Vedas and Tantras, and uttara, having the authority of the Vedas and the utterances of the preceptor The texts which are called Agamas are seventyseven in number, five called as Subhagama, sixtyfour as Kaula and cight as Misra, The Agamas of the daksına variety declare that Tantra is part of Veda which is vidya and Kaula is the philosophy 159 Those who do not observe the rites of the Vedic kind are disqualified for the Sākta cult 160 Important works on the Sakta system are the encyclopaedic Prapancasăra 

Prapancas@ra attributed to Sankarācārya, Laksmanadesika's Säradatilaka, Bhaskararaya's Varivasyära. hasya and Lalità -sahasranāma-bhāṣya, Krsnananda Agama Vagisa's Tantrasara, Pūrnānandahamsa parivrājaka's Sritativacentāmaņi and others Laksmidhara's (1497-1539) commentary on the Saundaryalahari contains valuable information on the cult of Šaktı 

The Saiva Agamas hold that Siva is the Supreme Deity ever associated with Sakti, identified with Devi or Pärvati Several schools are mentioned as coming under this head. They are

Srikanthasıvācārya (c 1400 A.D) wrote the Brahmamīmāmsð, a commentary on the Brahmasūtras upholding the Visiṣtādvaita aspect of Vedanta and propounding that Siva with Sakti is the Supreme Being. On this commentary Was written the Sıvārkamanıdıpikā, a super-commentary by Appayyadikşıta 

The other sects of Saivism such as Pāšupata, Lākula, Kālā- mukha et. lost their independent existence, having merged in a way and giving rise to Visesadvaita or Virašaivism which spread in Andhra and Karnataka regions. The founder was Reņuka- carya 166

Agamas are treated as authorising practices such as wearing the rudrāksa. Sivalinga and others Siva is held to reside in six places (satsthala) nim.ly, the five senses and the mind He must be visualized in them Every act must be surrendered to Him. 

Saivism in Kishmir accepts ninety two Agamas which were held to be bised on Dvaita, Advaita and Dvartädvarta The Doarta and Dvaitādvaita became amalgami ed into a single group called Siddhanta These Agamas preached sixtyfour systems of Siva cults of which Trika is one Tantric domination was marked in Triha What exactly this name denotes is not clear 188 The Trika has three sub-group, called Pratyabhijñāśastra, Āgama- Sastra and Spandasastra Pratyabhijñāsästra represents the The Agamasastra deals with the The Spandaśästra deals with the

The Ultimate Reality in the system is Mahesvira who bas two aspects, nam ly prakasa and vimarsa, which stand respect- ively for universal consciousness and physical activity Prakasa

Mahesvara has self-dependent power which evolves the variegated world of Nature, having prakasa as the substratum for mani- festations and vimarsa as the process of manifestation going on In this substratum This manifestation is called abhasa which is real The subject and object of knowledge are both manifesta- tions of the Supreme Being, Mahesvara The phenomenon of knowledge is like the rise of two waves of the sea of universal consciousness.

The Saiva Agamas were given a monistic interpretation by Tryambaka (c. 400 A.D.); the Sivadṛsti of Somānanda (850 A D) gives for the first time a systematic exposition of the system He was therefore the founder of the school His son and pupil, Utpaladeva, composed the Pratyabhyña sutra and the Isoara- pratyabhyjñā-kārikā with his own glosses thereon The greatest contributor was Abhinavagupla (c. 1050 A D) His Tantraloka is encyclopaedic in range, dealing with all the schools of Kashmir Saivism He commented upon Utpaladeva and many Saiva Agamas and wrote glosses on what others had written on them The Malinivijaya-värttika, Paratrumsika-vṛtti, and Paramarthasāra could be mentioned in this connection 

It 

The place for Šikti is thus prominent in the Sakta Āgamas only Its importarce in others is in subordination to God plays an important role in Kashmir Saivism The Saivasiddhänta in South India has received a powerful impact from the concept of Sakti in the Säkta Agamas, as a result of which Parvati has gained prominence along with Siva and bears several names 

The Vaisnava Agamas glorify Visnu as the Supreme Being to the exclusion of other deities They treat the Ultimate Reality as not mere Vişnu but Visņu with Sri While there are several nam's for Vişnu, the use of the word ' Vaisnava' as an epithet for these Agamas shows that they must be closely related to the Vedas where He is mentioned primarily by this name 

Most modern scholars in India and abroad hold that both Visnu and Rudra occupy subordinate positions in the Vedas and that Vaisnavism as a religion arose later than Saivism. 173 This view requires careful examination 

The Vedas (particularly Rgveda) have gained their present form through the efforts of Kṛṣṇadvaipayana who acquired the

title of Vyasa 174 The need to arrange the Vedas, under the direction of his father, Parāśara,175 must have been felt because all the Vedas during that period must have been mixed up so that the clear distinction of each Veda could not be made So Vvasa was asked to arrange them in order. He picked out the rks and prepared the Rgveda and similarly the other Vedas, Brahmanas and other portions, following some principles 176 Certainly, the arrangement of the hymns was not made in the chronological order or with reference to the superiority of one deity over another It is therefore futile to attempt to find out which rks were composed earlier and which Liter Equally hard is it to determine whether Rudra or Visnu, Savity or Varun was the earliest deity adored by the ancient seurs of India So the question of the relative prominence of anv deity in the Rgueda cannot be answered Visnu and Rudra could have been held in high regard then. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is not proper to assume that some deities were prominent in the Rgveda and lost their position later to Vişņu and Rudra who thus emerged into pre-eminence after having occupied subordinate positions earlier 

Again, Sürya, Varuga, Yama and others are still objects of worship, though not with as much veneration as Visņu and Rudra It is not possible to pick out the specific traits of the deities from the Rgveda, since all of them have hymns addressed to them and are offer. d oblations in the sacred fire Yet, a close, comparative study of the few hymns addressed to Vişņu and Rudra would show that people depinded more on these deities

for their security and well-being than on others While Vispu offered protection to the people providing them with the means for happy living,177 Rudra was looked upon as a terrible deity. ready to award punishment to 

wrong doers Naturally, the sages prayed to Rudra for pardon and for gifts enabling them to Itad a prosperous life with kith and kin 178 This explanation could be offered to justify the continued primacy which Vispu and Rudra have been enjoying 

While studying the nature of Vaisnavism, it becomes neces- sary to take into account the development of the Visnu cult in the source books Apart from the Vedas, there are the epics, the Puranas and other such works. The difficulty of getting evidence to determine the antiquity of the cult is immense, since the dates of these source-noks are yet to be fixed with a fair degree of accuracy 

The tradition of the Hindus, however, fixes the periods of these sources at a very ancient date Modern researchers find these dates unacceptable 

However, it must be

ad nitted that dates as arrived at by modern research also have their own limitations as regards accuracy The date of the compilation of the Mahabharata may not be far later than the beginning of the Kaliyuga, when the war described in 

the epic was fought. This date is fixed at 3102 B C 179 which is cited180 and whose author is Mahābhārata must be more ancient and definitely before the beginning of the Kaliyuga The Puranas are held to be the compositions of Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata, and so are to be placed about the beginning of the Kaliyuga The Bhagavadgita forms part of the Mahābhārata

At the same time, it is necessary to take into account the accretions, losses, changes and interpolations which have entered into these texts from time to time, The Mahabharata is said to have been available in its present form from about the beginning of the Christian era 182 This, however, does not prove that further changes did not take place after this period. It can only be said that by the beginning of the Christian era the two epics were available more or less in their present forms and known by their present names 

The same must be said of the Bhagavadgita and the Puranas. Curiously enough, the Purāņas: have undergone several changes which make it difficult to identify their genuine portions The Visnupuräna is mentioned as a Vaispava text in the Tamil classic, Manımıkhalaı,183 which is to be placed much earlier than 6th century A D, when Buddhism flourished unhampered at Kañci before the renaissance of Saivism and Vaisnavism there under the patronage of the Pallava rulers This Purana must have become well known 

before the Tamil epic was written It will not be wrong to place it two centuries at least before 4th century AD, when the Manımekhalat was written 

The Bhagavatapurana presents a problem regarding its date. Its contents are undoubtedly very old The spirit of devotion to God premeates it But the text is not mentioned by Sankara (8th century AD) and Rāmāruja (1017-1137 A D) 

This, however, is only negative evidence The Visnupurana was then available to serve the purpose of upabrmhana184, and the other Puranas, because their contents were more or less the same,

: 

There were four currents of thought on Godhead, all of which were promoting salient and dominant traits which later on came to be identified as displayed by Visnu. These were about Visņu, Näräy na, Bhagavan and Vasudeva, the theistic character of which could be traced to different sources Vişou is already a Vedic deity Narayana gets glorified in the Mahābhā. rata 'Bhagavan' is the Lord of the Bhagavadgitä, Viṣṇupurāņa and Bhagavata Vasudeva is prominent in the Visnupurana Omni- presence, omnipotence, readiness to come down to sufferers, offering them relief from their misery, displaying miracles to convince them of His greatness and willingness to forgive the sioners and even those who offend Him are some of the features of the Deity who is widely mentioned in the sources listed above. These traits have made it possible to regard all the four names as standing for one Deity, so that the specific features and concepts found associated with each in the respective sources came to be attributed to that one Deity. The fusion of these currents has already taken place in the source books, which must be looked upon as records of the concepts when they took a definite shape. 

The Vedas do not refer to any of these names except Visņu and perhaps to Narayana The mangalasloka,188 the Naraya- niya section187 and other passages in the Mahabharata refer to

He took three strides217 for the well-being of the world and provided those who were attached to Him with accomodation in distant lands like Uru and Ksiti218 (that appear to be located in Mesapotamia) This act, along with rescuing the world from a cosmic deluge, has won unique fame for His descents 23 Varaha219 and Vamana 220 

He is ever associated with Sri, though the Vedic hymns as such do not have a reference to this association.221 

This asso- ciation continues even during divine descents.222 

He Himself creates the world 223 and, pervading it as its Inner controller, 224 protects it from insecurity 

The sacred rites are identified with Him who is also the only receiver of the offerings made there 225 

The arca form of worship, which seems to be not known in the Vedas, became known in the epics 226 and, more so, in the Purānas227 and particularly, the Visnu and the Bhagavata

The Lord is pleased with any kind of offering, however insignificant it may235 be, and He proclaims that His devotee will never perish 236 

The temples in which the worship of the Lord in arcă is conducted are mostly situated in South India Each ancient temple of Visnu has its greatness (sthalamāhātmya) recorded in the Puranas 237 Hoary antiquity is claim d for most of them

Whether this can be upheld or not, it is not irrational to recognize the contribution made by such accounts in the Puranas 

A reference to some of these shrines is found in Tamil classical texts such as Silappadıkāram,238 and Paripadal239 and others Other such works include Akanānūru,240 Puranānūru, 241 and Kalittokar 242 They describe Visņu graphically, depicting Him to be the foremost, and contain allusions to the divine descent243 of the Lord 

The above-mentioned aspects of Vaisnavism are dealt with in the Vaisnava Agamas There could have been mutual indebt- edness between them and the epics and Purāṇas which are found to make use of certain doctrines forming the fundamental principles treated in the Agamas In the long history of the development of Hindu culture which is of an all-embracing character, the various branches of knowledge could not have risen in isolation nor undergone development and flourished without influencing one another 

The Vaisnava Āgamas reveal certain peculiar traits Firstly, the Supreme Reality is Visnu with Sri and they are insepa- rably associated with each other 244 Secondly, other deities are held to form part of the retinue of Visnu Thirdly, the arca form of worship gets detailed treatment which includes the

erection of temples and conducting private and public festivals. Lastly, they enjoin the worship of God in the household 245 

The Vaisnava Agamas are of two kinds, namely, Pañcarā tra and Vaikhanasa The former is more liberal in its outlook and 

practice than the latter Tantrika practices have exerted a very deep influence on the Pañcaratra, while the Vaikhanasa is free from it. Naturally, tantrika mantras have no role to play in the Vaikhanasa Agama 

The Vathhanasa Agama perhaps arose earlier than the Pañca- vatra on account of its pure Vedic links The following passage indicates this conclusion 

वैखानसं श्रीशास्त्रं प्राहुरेकायनाभिधम् । शास्त्रेणैकायनाख्येनार्चितेऽत्र हरौ पुरा 

" 

सर्वे श्रीहरिसान्निध्यं गता वै जीवकोटयः । न स्वर्गो नापि नरको न जन्ममरणे तथा ॥ श्रीशास्त्रस्यैव रक्षार्थ पूजनार्थ तथापदि । पाञ्चरात्रं पुनर्प्राह शास्त्रं वैष्णवमुत्तमम् ॥ 

S.A. LXV 117-119 

It is said that Vaikhänasa is Srișăstra (or a holy sastra) called ' Ekayana ', When Hari was worshipped in olden times In accordance with the system called Vaikhanasa, all the groups (or crores) of living beings attained the presence of Hari There was (then ) no paradise nor hell, and no birth and death The Lord uttered the best Vaisnava system, Рäñcaratra, to safeguard the holy system and also for (preserving the mode of) worship during danger.

Here the word, ‘Śrīšāstra', may be taken to mean 'a holy system' or 'a system in which Sri is dealt with". In the former, case, Sri' is only an honorific and in the latter, it indicates that the system is intended to glorify Śri The word, ekāyana', means the only one or unique path for salvation. This is the Ekāyana system mentioned in the Chandogya Upanisad246 as a subject of study among others This is said to be the name of a recension of the Veda which is now lost The following passage is said to convey what this recension stood for.

T A. III 12 7 

According to this passage, a person becomes immortal here by knowing Him to be thus, that is, as depicted above in the Purusasükta The word 'veda' is to be taken in the sense of worship (upasana)247 As it is said here that there is no other way available to get mokṣa, this method, namely, the worship of Visnu called 'Purusa', is to be adopted 

In the passage cited above from the Vaikhānasa Āgama, it is evident that worship of the Lord takes the worshipper to Him. It is not, however, stated there that all the selves had obtained moksa, but only that they had gone near Hari (Sriharisannidhya). This means that they, if they had not really obtained moksa, or other selves who were still waiting to be sent to the mortal world to have the experiences of the results of their past deeds, would be coming down to earth By then, the Srisästra might was brought into being The

safeguard the Vaskhānasa system. The word 'prāha' must indicate that Pañcarātra was uttered by Hari 

The word,ekayana', in the passage cited above, presents a difficulty The Pañcarātra and not the Vaikhānasa is believed to be based on the Ekayana which is also called Rahasyamnāya 248 The references to this in many texts249 are not easy to reconcile with the sense of the passage cited above from the Varkhānasa Agama However, this statement is a good piece of evidence for the Pancarätra being closely allied to it. 

There is again a reference250 in the Pañcaratra tradition to the offering of the effigy of a beast made of flour (pistapasu) in the sacrifice where an animal is to be slain and offered. A similar rite, with the name, Visnuyaga,251 is referred to in the Vaikhānasa Āgama, It is not clear whether it originally formed part of the Pañcarā tra tradition or was adopted mainly on grounds of kindness to animals Anyway, this sacrifice lends support to believing that both Ägamas have the same tradition, though the ritual is enjoined as a means of expiation in the Vaikhanasa 

There is also another way of explaining the above passage. The Ekayana recension must have been the basic foundation for the development of the concept of absolute devotion (paramat- kānustva) The Vaikhanasa must have developed out of this recension and, in this respect, has to be regarded as akin to the Pancaratra The latter had a specific development with provi sion made for the yantras and tāntrika mantras which are absent in the former. The two do not have much divergence in the main concepts of Vaisnavism An Upanisad called Sitopanışad alludes

to Vaikhanasa (and not Vikhanasa), a sage who is an exponent of such important doctrines as 

as those relating to the three powers, iccha, jnäna and kriya, and others, which are treated only in the Pañcaratra system This work, though perhaps relatively late, seeks to show the sage Vikhanas as associated with the Pañcaratra system 252 An approach on the basis of this reference may justify the passage in the Samurtarcanadhikaraṇa253 Yet the frequent references to the Pancarātra as based on the Ekayana recension,254 cannot be easily explained away 

The following verses from the Pâñcarātra Agama lend sup- port to the concept of absolute devotion of the Vaikhānasa 255 fa¤ à¤raereor à à ¤ærmagerà | gorffaaeg &raear terá an-garfaa: 1 कर्तव्यमिति देवेशं संयजन्ते फलं विना ।

That the Vaikhānasas do not worship any other deity and worship Visqu out of a sense of duty and without expecting any results, makes it clear that they must be following the Ekayana 

recension. 

The Bhagavata contains a reference to Vikhanas having prayed to the Lord for descending down to the earth and to the descent of the Lord in the family of the Sattvatas.

The word, 'Vekhanas ', must be taken to mean Brahma who made a request to the Lord for the divine descent on earth 256 Vallabhācārya, the founder of the Suddhādvasta system of Vedanta, takes this word to mean Vikhanas, the sage and founder of the Varkhanasa system 257 This interpretation would support the sense of the passage cited above in the Samūrtärcanādhıkarana Then the Pancarātra system must be admitted to have sprung long after the Vaikhanasa Yet the problem remains unsolved Brahma is mentioned in the Visnupurana and Bhagavata258 as having approached the Lord and made a request to Him to de- scend on earth The word 'Vilhanas' means Brahma besides the sage with that name The expression, visvaguptaye', means for protec ing the universe This protection, as far as the descent of Krsna is concerned, was desired by the gods to be effected through lightening the burden on earth The Pañcarātra doctrines receive exposition through the Lord, but the main purpose served by His descent is fulfilled only through the removal of the evil forces, and so this achievement, which is in consonance with the request made of Him by Brahma, should be considered as of primary significance In fact, all the divine descents of the Lord have served this main purpose It is not therefore appropriate to take the passage as being in favour of bringing the sage Vikhanas into the picture. Ingenuity, how- ever, plays the chief role in these interpretations 

the context, however, does not support them

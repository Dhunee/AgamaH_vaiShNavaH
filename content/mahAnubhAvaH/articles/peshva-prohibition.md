This is Manbhāū sect that was prohibited from missionary activities and whose members were declared to lose their caste by the Government in June of 1782 for the reason that they destroyed Hindu temples and idols, shaved their heads in their own way, and wore their own special clothes. Regarding the sect, see I. M. P. Raeside: "A Bibliographical Index of Mahānubhāva Works in Marathi,” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, vol. 23, Part 3, 1960, pp. 464-507.

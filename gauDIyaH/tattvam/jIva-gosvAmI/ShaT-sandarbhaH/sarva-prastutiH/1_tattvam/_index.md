Edition 3.01 2020.06.15

The following printed editions were used in making this text:



- (ed.) Sitanath Goswami, Jadavpur University, 1967. (only mula and Baladeva)
- (ed.) Haridas Shastri. Vrindavan, 1983. (mula and all commentaries)
- (ed.) Kanailal Adhikari. (Mayapur: Gopinath Gaudiya Math, 1998) (mula, Baladeva and _Sarva-samvādinī_).
- Puridas edition of 1953 for _Sarva-samvādinī_. [This edition has been used by 2 and 3 above.]
- Another edition of _Sarva-samvādinī_, (ed.) Rasikamohan Sarma Vidyabhusana (Bangiya Sahitya Parisat, 1327=1921 CE).

The numbering has been adjusted slightly. The old numbering system has been kept, but the following should be noted. The Tattva-sandarbha differs from the other five sandarbhas in that it is divided into two sections—the _Pramāṇa-prakaraṇam_ and the _Prameya-prakaraṇam_. The first section establishes the authority of the Bhāgavatam as a source of revealed knowledge or shabda. The second enters into the content of the Bhāgavata-sandarbha. Thus the numbering system followed throughout the rest of the Bhāgavata-sandarbha only begins with the _Prameya-prakaraṇam_, with each section corresponding to the main Bhāgavata verse under discussion. This is apparently what Puridas followed in the numbering in his _Sarva-samvādinī_ edition. Baladeva is the apparent source of the current numbering system, which he himself announces at the end of the commentary to the first verse.

In order to facilitate the recognition of the different commentaries, the following color-code has been used:



- Jiva’s original text is in bold black. I have used the same colors here as in other editions of the Sandarbhas—violet for the main verse under discussion, blue for other quoted material. To further complicate matters, I have used green to indicate quoted commentaries by other authors, usually Sridhar Swami. These are all in bold. (The great advantage of this electronic format is that you, the reader, are free to change anything you like!)
- _Sarva-samvādinī_ is in green.
- Baladeva Vidyabhushana in violet.
- Radha Mohan Goswami in brown. (Seems to be incomplete)
- Gaura-kishora Goswami in plum. (Seems to be incomplete)

PRAPANNA PARIJATA. 
CHAPTER V. 
ON THE SERVING OF GOD. 
(Continued from page 101) 
1. Thus by the grace of the Guru attended with the knowledge of one's subserviency to God (Seshatva),* ever despising sound and other objects of the senses, even as other deities than God, he who, desirous of the fruit of attaining Vishnu, has bhakti for his means, is a Vaishnavat (follower of Vishnu). 
2. Having concluded that the means of bhakti is use- less equally with the worship of other deities than God, and of the physical objects of enjoyment, he who adopts Krishna (the supreme spirit) as the sole means for the attainment of Krishna, is an ekānti (i, e, one whose mind is devoted to one object). 
3. He is a Paramekanti (the supreme ekanti) who 
Sesha: One whose nature is solely towards the attribution of another's supremacy, is the Sesha of that other and is subser- vient to his purposes. Seshi is one who holds everything at his own disposal and appropriates it for his own purposes. Accord- ing to the Visishthadvaita system the relation between the ruler and the ruled, the Isvara and the jiva is Sesha-seshi-bhava- and it is eternal. 
+ According to the Vaishnava theology a Prapanna is of two kinds; the ekanti or one who is devoted to one object and the Parmekanti, the supreme ekanti. ▲ Paramekanti is again of two kinds: the arta, or the afflicted, and the Dripta, or the proud or contented. 
 

135 
holds that the several means (for moksha), the deities other than God, the objects of the senses, bhakti and prapatti known as Krishna (having Krishna as the means and end) are all equal and has also the notion of the lord and the appropriator in Hari. 
4. In knowing the subserviency of his self, and in always doing service to the lotus-feet of the lord, he shall, thus spend his time usefully. 
5. Learning from the guru the meaning of the basic mantra (Nārāyanāya) as being of the same import as doava and having God as his sole refuge, he shall worship Hari with that (mantra). 
6.-7. In accordance with his ability he shall worship God with the basic mantra daily three times. This basic mantra is the essence of the teaching of the whole Vedanta. It enables one to cross the ocean of samsara. Of all the mantras it is the highest mantra; of all the secrets it s the best secret; it is the purest of the pure and is eternal. 8. By those that are desirous of freedom it is worthy of silent utterance at all times as giving the fruits of world- ly enjoyment (bhukti) and freedon (mukti). By the Vaishnavas it is worthy of uttarance as fostering knowledge and love (Jnāna and bhakti). 
9. 
It is the divine source of all the mantras, and is capable of destroying all sins. Becoming calm and collec- ted one shall diligently utter it. 
10.-11. As there is thus the injunction of the com- mander of the hosts (Senesa) to Gajanana (the elephant- faced God) and other hosts, either with this mantra shall a Vaishnava always conduct the worship &c. of Hari, or with the mantra dvaya shall he perform it preceded by salutation to his 
guru. 
12. Only after having put on the marks of a Vaish- nava shall a Vaishnava worship Hari. The sage Vyāsa 
 
156 
 
says that only (by those of) the castes who have got the marks on should Mādhava (God) be worshipped, served and adored. 
13. These marks are said to be of two kinds: exter- nal and internal. The marks like those of the conch, the disc &c., are external, and the absence of desire and other passions is the other. 
14. So also has the Atharvopanishad clearly and specially prescribed the wearing of the disc-mark &c., to the discerning which (in general) is (also.) established in all the Upanishads. 
15. Seers of Brahman know that a Vipra shall bear on his right arm the mark of the disc and on his left that of the conch. 
16.-17. If the authorities above mentioned are to be doubted as being Vedic, we say that, even the whole lot of mantras are equally to be so. 
If On account of their acceptance by great men as being Vedic, there is doubted no doubt (on that score). (If doubt arises again) the Pādma and Agneya-Puranas with raised hands do, indeed, proclaim aloud their authoritativeness. 
18. By those that are advanced in love and faith (bhakti and Sraddha) the five weapons (of God) are to be worn separately each on one place; on the forehead, on the head, on the chest and on the two arms. 
19. On the forehead the mace is to be worn; on the head the bow (Saranga), on the middle of the chest the sword (Nandaka), and on the two arms the conch and the disc. 
20. With metallic models which have been heated in fire and over which their respective mantras have been pronounced, shall one be marked. Even Vriddha-Manu has said this with care. 
21. To that man who daily wears the vertical marks (ūrdhvapuudra) and the disc mark (chakra) good ever in- 

Frapannaparijala. 
créases and evil disappears. 
157 
22.-33. The time for wearing the disc and other marks has been mentioned by Bhagavan in the Pancha- ratra-sastra. Under sixteen years is the best time, till the fiftieth middling and after that bad. Such is the determi- nation of time. All the months of the year excepting the winter ones (Varshika) are also auspicious. 
24- 
In the Pancharatra are prescribed in extenso, the place, measurement, and the material of urdhvapundra. One shall wear it according to that (prescription.) 
25. Then shall urdhvapundra be painted with white mud, produced on the top of a sacred mountain and such other holy places, especially by the Vaishnavas. 
26. He who wears a pure and white urdhvapundra with interspaces, builds Me with it a clean temple. 
27. 
A heart untouched by desire and other passions, a speech unsullied by lies and other faults, a body unimpair- el by torture and other injuries, these are the three kinds of worship in relation to Kesava (God). 
28-29. Non-injury, the first flower; control of the senses, another; kindness to all beings, a flower; forgive- ness preeminently a flower; knowledge, a flower; austeri- ties, a flower; meditation, again the seventh flower; and truth, (one more);-these eight kinds of flowers are dear to Vishnu (God). 
30-32. Thus with body adorned with the marks, ex- ternal and internal, having bathed in holy waters and off- ered libations of water to the Devas, the manes, and other deities as ordained in the săstras, having diligently mutter- ed hundred and eight times the basic mantra (mūlamantra) and making ready all the articles for sweet smearing, as also articles of food and of divine service, and having finished the decoration of the yoga-bhumi (the place of worship) 
* Fogabhumi: Literally means the place for meditation, 
* 
 
158 
 
one shall worship Hari in accordance with the routine t established by the prince of sannyasins (yatindra). 
33. Just as a servant overcome with love pleases the king, his master, in the same way, shall one please the Lord of one's self, God, free from subterfuge, by going round the object of worship, placing it always to the right (pradakshina), and by prostrations and praises approved of by the ekantis. 
34. The whole aggregate of the angas of bhakti, which Vishnu in the shape of the mighty Varaha has said to Agastya, shall one diligently practice, in due time. 
35-37. "Affection for My devotees, rejoicing in their worships, worship by one's self, avoidance of pomp in My affairs, devotion to the hearing of My deeds, agita- tion (or change in the expression) in the voice, eyes and limbs (when so hearing), constant remembering of Me daily, and the (consciousness of) the fact that one depends not on Me for any worldly advantage, these are the eight kinds of bhakti. Even in a mlechcha* (Barbarian) if this bhakti exists, he is to be taken as the holiest of Brahmins; he is the greatest of sages; he is a yati (one who has renounced the world and controlled the passions); and he is a savant (pandit); to him ought to be given (gifts) and from him ought it to be received; even as I am is he worthy of worship." 
hence the place of worship of any bind. The idea is that when a man sits for meditation or worship, he should on no account get distracted and leave his seat, but should remain comfortably seated till everything is finished, 
+ The reference here is to the Nitya-karma or daily liturgy of the Sri-Vaishnavas as arranged by Sri Ramanuja. 
Mlechcha: is from mlechch, to talk confusedly. i e. a barba- rian or non-Aryan who does not conform to the Aryan institution and does not speak the Sanskrit language but speaks a barbarous tongue. 

Prapannaparijuta. 
159 
38.-39. On the authority of Saunaka even the incar- nation in images for the purpose of worship (archavatara) shall one worship. Having made with gold, silver or any other metals a beautiful image of Vishnu with gracious face and eyes which shall excite one's own love, and em- bodying in it the Brahman, one shall become mentally absorbed in it. 
40. It, one shall worship; it, one shall salute; it, one shall serve ; it, one shall contemplate; and casting away all impurities, it alone which is the image (visible) of 
Brahman, one enters. 
41. Doing even a mere trifle one shall live in a tem- ple of Vishnu. Ever living in a temple of Vishnu one shall do the service of God as much as it lies in his power. 
42. What might be a mighty temple, or a dear orna- ment, or a suitable enjoyment to Vishnu, that shall not be meddled with even in the least with the idea of its be- ing the means (to a desired end). 
43. That hour or even moment when Vasudeva (God) is not thought of,—that itself is a loss; that is a huge opening to disaster; that is an aberration of the mind; that is a mental disorder. 
44. If even a single hour were to be passed away without meditation (by any person) it is fit to be wept over very much as when he is robbed by a thief. 
45. Having churned (i. e. entered into) all the sastras and examined them again and again, we find this one ulti- mate clear conclusion viz., that Narayana ought to be ever meditated upon. 

CHAPTER VI. 
ON THE WORSHIP OF THE ATTENDANTS ON 
GOD. 
I. 1. Then the goddess Lakshmi ought to be specially worshipped by a Prapanna, along with (the goddesses) Bhumi, Nila and such others, also with Sutravati and other attendants (on Lakshmi). 
2. She is the resting place of Gurus, and the ruler of this world, the divine consort of the God of gods and is eternal and imperishable. 
3. In the Pancharatra-Sastra, Vishnu has said to the attentive Vishvaksena to the effect that he who is a bhakta of Lakshmi, of Myself and of persons of your stamp,' is rare to meet with on this earth. 
4. After collecting all the materials for the worship of Hari, one shall worship therewith the goddess also who is the consort of the; God of gods in the same manner as he worships God. 
5. After mentioning the five kinds of manifestations 
The manifestations of God (Isvara) according to the Pancharatra sastras are fivefold: Para, the essential and supreme manifestation, as it appears in the empyrean, (Vaikuntha) of Vishnu which is only one; Vyuha, the group of partial manifes- tations which are recognised as fourfold, Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha; Vibhava, the part manifestations of cosmic energy which are innumerable as seen in the incarna- tions of Rama, Krishna &c., Antaryamin, the manifestation as abiding inside all beings; Archavatara, the incarnations in the form of holy images for the purpose of worship. These four grades of manifestation lead successively form the lowest image to the highest para. 
 
Prapannaparijala. 
161 
like the supreme (Para), the partial (Vyuha) and others of His Self, Hari says in Tatvaratna about her glory as follows:— 
6. "Similarly I shall state the nature of Lakshmi, listen to me calmly. Pervasion by quality and substance is considered to be the common nature of both (Her and Me). 7. Just as the universe is pervaded by Me both in essence and quality, all this is pervaded by Her (also). Therefore she is the Disposer and Ruler of all. 
8. "She is pervaded by Me and similarly I, the Lord am also pervaded by Her. Hear, therefore, Senesa! the difference between Me and Her. 
to Me. 
9. "My consort who is the ruler of all is subservient To Her as well as the universe that I am the Lord is well-known in the Vedas. 
10. 
"That the twofold power of manifestation (Nitya- vibhuti Etenal manifestation and Lilavibhuti: sportive manifestation) is at the disposal of both Her and Me, is evident, O mānada; (my pride!) from the Vedanta and the Pancharatra-Sastra taught by Me. 
II. 
"In the same way Bhumi and Nila are also con- sidered subservient to Me. As pervasion by intelligence is laid down to all souls, to these two is prescribed only per- vasion by quality and not by substance." 
12.-13. In the same sastra elsewhere, Lakshmi Herself has also said about the relation between Herself and Her Lord, their pervasion and rulership. By reason of His being (the Lord and appropriator) inseparably united with Her the Brahman is said to be non-dualistic (advaita.) 
14. "That Supreme energy of Brahman, which is as is light to the moon, is the goddess Lakshmi, who is coexistent with Brahman in all His conditions, and who is in His own nature indestructible. 
"I am that ancient (or eternal) One who is the 
5 
162 
 
''I-ness' of Brahman. He, the Brahman, is the (essence) or the inner Self of all beings, and after becoming 'I' of all beings is known as Hari. I am, therefore, that ancient One who is the 'I-ness' of all beings. 
16. *Whatever form (of a thing) there is,-(all that) is the eternal Vasudeva; (for) the Brahman constitutes the essential existence and form (of all things): hence That is the abode of immortality. 
17. "God, Narayana, is the essence of existence; and I, the Supreme Lakshmi, am the attribute (be-ness') of it. Hence what is known as Lakshmìnārāyana is the Brahman which is the eternal One. 
18.-19. "The notion of 'I' is got only as united with 'I-ness.' And that which takes its rise in the notion of 'I' is known as 'I-ness.' On account of this connection of mutual inseparable existence and of mutual sequence, know the relation between Me and My Lord to be that of attribute and essence." 
20.-21. The sage Parāsara say's of Her who is of the nature of Brahman: 
"She is eternal, the mother of the universe, the glory of Vishnu, and imperishable. O thou, the purest of 
* According to the Visishthadvaita Philosophy, the substance can have no real existence apart from quality and the quality can have existence only as inherent in substance. No idea can have a corresponding reality of existence unless it is capable of being resolved into essence or the 'thing-in-itself' and attribute through which we cognise the reality. Here the Brahman in order that it may be posited to exist ultimately (bhavat), is capable of being viewed in its dual aspect of existence, bhava, the essence of existence and bhāva, its attribute. Lakshmi says this essence to be Narayana and attribute to be Herself; and Lakshmi-Narayana is the One Existence, the Brahman. 
 
(( 

Brahmins! Just as Vishnu is all-pervading so also is she." 
22. Among gods, animals and men, the glorious Hari is the masculine name and Lakshmi is the feminine name. O Maitreya! there is nothing higher than these. 
23.-26. I salute that consort of the Bestower of boons (Varadavallabha) who by being the Beloved of God, previous to their having recourse to her Lord occupies, of Her own accord, the position of mediatrix to men,-to men that are solely addicted to sinful deeds and are for a long time unworthy and promotes affection, mercy and such other feelings in Her Lord, who at the time of His becom- ing the means fosters knowledge, energy and other attri- butes in Him, who for the enhancement of the enjoyments. of the freed augments the qualities of beauty, &c, who is endowed with the three capacities of (upayatva, being the means, upeyatva, being the end, and purushakāratā, being the mediatrix), and who dwells in a lotus and is the ruler of the whole world. 
27. "Similarly one shall worship by their respective mantras Bhumi and Nila and other innumerable consorts. and the important of the eternals (nityasuris). 
28. "One shall worship with retinue the minister of Vishnu, Senesa (the commander of the hosts), under the sway of the rod; in whose hand lies the world;which is of the nature of intelligence and non-intelligence (chit and achit) ̧ 
29. In due order, one shall worship the eternals, Ananta, Garuda, and a host of others with their re- tinue; the weapons, disc, &c; the consorts of God; the attendants of Lakshmi, Sútravati and others;-all these and their retinue. 
30. Those gods, who, having casually gone to the temple of Vishnu, serve Him, ought not to be worshipped by mumukshus unless they are ranked in the order of the eternals, 
 
164 
The Brahmaradin. 
32. And what Vishnu says to the attentive Vishvak- sena regarding those in particular that are unworthy of the worship of mumukshus is as follows:-- 
33-38. Whoever is of super-human dignity and goodness, is especially favoured by the goddess of fortune, is devoid of love and hatred, and is by himself strong and powerful-know carefully every one of these to be portions of My spirit for the purpose of My work. 
Such persons as these, who are governed by Divine manifestation, are all of them individual souls (jivātmans) and therefore they ought not to be worshipped by the Vaishnavas. 
39-40. They are merely entered into, O limitlessly glorious one! by My spirit on purpose, and O Sapient one, they are all unworthy of worship by reason of its being incongruous. And they, even though dwelt in by me, do, indeed, partake of the nature of jtva and are possessed of egotism. 
41-42. Those manifestations who, on account of being largely parts of my spirit, are important, who have not given up their own true nature and who are Divine and are of superhuman bodies, and have arisen like one light from another for the protection of the world-those, O Senesa, are indeed worthy of worship for the sake of crossing the ocean of samsăra. 
45. "O tiger of men! Other deities who to the sages are not proper objects of resort-all of them are impure; for the Devas and other gods are sprung from Karma" 
(To be Continued.) 
 
CHAPTER VII. 
ON SERVING THE VIRTUOUS. 
1. For the removal of doubt in what we have learnt and for mutual enlightenment, sages (sadhus) should be sought; for, the virtuous are the cure of attachment. 
2. Bhagavan Vyasa (illustrious) says regarding the remedy for the renunciation of sense-objects as follows:- 
"By all means attachment is to be given up. If it is not possible to give up, sadhus should be sought after; for, the virtuous are the cure of attachment. 
3-4. Whenever a doubt arises as regards one's own conduct and action, approaching with humility such sages (vipras) as have well deliberated, and are perfect and steady in the path of virtue, one shall learn the solution. What- ever course of conduct they pursue in the particular case in view that course a virtuous man shall (in his case) adopt. 
5. Sages aught to be sought even though they do not give a single instruction. For, even what they spontaneously talk become Sastras. 
6-7. Saunaka says about the visiting of sadhus by virtuous men as follows:- 
"The place where a holy man (bhagavata) lives, even though it be a long way off, should be resorted to and the holy man seen even though with exertion, for, therein lives Hari (God)." 
8. 
"Visiting the sadhus is a meritorious act; for, are not the sadhus sacred? A holy object yields fruits in course of time but the intercourse with sadhus forthwith." 
9. Bhagavan Suka says that praising the qualities of 
 

295 
the virtuous is, as it were, the fruit of knowledge long acquired, in the following terms. 
10. No fruit has directly been proclaimed by the sages to persons whose learning is one of long labour, there- fore is (advised) the constant thinking of the qualities of those in whose heart is the lotus-feet of the lord (Makanda).' 
11. 46 
By the good, the sages that have come to their house aught to be specially worshipped with kind words, with offerings of water to the hand &c., and with agreeable food in a fit way. 
12. "One shall not wash the feet (of a guest) in a ves- sel made of bell-metal, is the injunction of the Smritis. Therefore in other vessels like the mud ones, shall one wash. And Bhagavan Suka says as follows:- 
13. "Those houses that are destitute of holy water from the feet of spiritually great men, even though these be not devoid of all sorts of riches, are verily the trees (sandal) which are the abode of serpents. 
14. 
"The adoration of the holy-water from the feet of the devotees of God, is determined by the wise to be the atonement for all sins. 
15. "This water is to be received on the head, as well as on the limbs and eyes and other members of the head. It is to be taken in the same way as the soma Juice where there is not the religious ceremony of sipping (ochamana). 
16. "O holiest of the twice-born! if the water of the feet of Vishnu as well as of the bhaktas of Vishnu be drunk no ceremony of sipping should be practised as (is done) in the case of the soma-Juice." 
17. Lord Krishna washing with his own hands the feet of the guest, Narada, in the houses of all his beloved (Gopis), drank the holy water of the feet of that sage. 
18. For the promotion of the knowledge of one's sub- serviency to God (Seshatva), in one's house one shall, atten-

ded with the consciousness of their tripleness* (prapya; object of attainment; prapaka: the means, and Seshi: appropria- tor), gratify the Vaishnavas with repasts which are to their liking and are in consonance with the Sastras. 
19. After they have finished eating a truly pious man should eat the remnant. For those virtuous men who eat the leavings are liberated from all sins. 
20. The conversation and such other intercourses with them, the Lord has mentioned in the Pancharatra-Sastra :- 
"What the twice-born, who ride the charioty of the Vedas and wield the sword of knowledge, shall utter even in sport that is considered as the highest ethics (dharma).” 21. "The Vedic scholars know those alone to be dharma-Sastra (codes of law) that are the practices of men who have taken refuge with Vasudeva." 
22. Men are rendered pure by the mere sight of the Vaishnavas, but not so much by holy places. Sounaka says as follows: 
23. "O King! a being is not made so holy even by thousands of holy waters as by the mere look of Vaishnavas cast as if in sport. 
24. Residing within a cage of the flames of fire is Commendable and not the torment of association with men who are averse to the thought of Souri (God). 
25. Great sage! I am the slave of those that touch the Bhagavatas (the godly) with their limbs, even sit near (them), see (them) even, and hear (them). 
26. With the good alone one should live, with the good one should associate, also with the good quarrel and make friendship; but with the wicked nothing whatever shall

one have to do. 

297 
27. As Yayate having fallen among the good re- gained his own position from there, even so one falling among the good does not get embarassed. 
CHAPTER VIII. 
ON THE DETERMINATION OF KARMAS FROM 
AMONG THE PRESCRIBED. 
1. The determination of the duties of a Prapanna from among those prescribed is dealt with at large- 
2. The obligatory duties prescribed in Sruti, Smriti and other Sastras aught to be performed. For the Lord of Lakshmi says "Sruti and Smriti are my own commands." 
3. A Prapanna shall also perform what is specially prescribed to him in the Punchuratra-Sustrus; that is, shall always do knitting garlands and such other works of God (Sriputi). 
4. Among those prescribed the determination of the duties of one practising Nyasavidya (the science of refuge- seeking), as said by Lakshmi in her own Tantra to the interrogating Indra, is as follows:- 
5. One who has renounced expedient and detrimental actions (upayapaya) and has followed a meduim course and who resolving that God will protect him, has laid down all The allusion is to the story of the Mahabharata. When Yayate the celebrated king of the lunar race, the son of Nahusha, was reaping the fruits of his merit in the Svargaloka, blinded with pride he one day used vile language towards the sages, which destroyed his punya and led his fall through a curse from Indra. But by the favour of the king of gods he fell among the sages called ashtakas and by their grace regained his lost position. 
 
298 
 
that one can claim as one's, shall recognise as the Protector, that God of gods, the Supreme Being. 
6. What course is it, mother! (ambike) that is midway between detrimental and expedient karmas? All actions rest solely on the quality of being expedient and detrimen- tal upayapayala). 
7. On the acceptance or the denial of prohibitory and mandatory injunctions (sastras), is clearly seen the expedient and detrimental naturedness of karmas (rites). 
8. Know, O king of the Devas! the mysterious course of karmas to be threefold. And learn from me the same classification (as it arises) from the prohibitory and manda- tory injunctions. 
9. Some are the means of producing evil (detrimental and some the means of accomplishing an object (expedient), while some other karmas are taught for the remedying of evil (expiatory). 
10. The classification of karma into three groups should thus be known by those that have the sastraic eyes. The first two groups designated the detrimental and the expedient (apayopaya), shall one relinquish. 
11, The third group which is for the remedying of evil is of two kinds. Some are of the expiatory nature and destroy the evil that has already arisen (prayaschittalmaka). This portion, like the previous groups, a wise man shall not practice. 
12. (Other karmas) which in being done do not happen towards any benefit whatever but in not being done (happen) towards evil-such karmas one shall surely prac- tise. 
13. This is that Vedic course of conduct which is midway between the detrimental and expedient ones. Re- maining in this shall one reach Janardana, the Lord of the universe, (jagannatha). 
 

299 
14-16. This is what has been taught here: such groups of actions as injuriousness, theft, &c., are the detri- mental karmas which are the means of producing evil; the kamyakarmas or the karmas performed with a view to some particular worldly object and future fruition, are those that are the means of accomplishing some object (expedient), such as, building temple and other worldly acts, as also Sankhya* yoga↑ and other means (for securing 
Sankhya: The system of philosophy attributed to the sage Kapila. This philosophy is so called because it enumerates, in order, twenty five Sattvas or verities, beginning with prakriti or pradhana, the primordial matter; and its chief object is to effect the final emancipation of the twenty fifth tattva, the Purusha or soul, from the bonds of worldly existence-the three miseries of life-by obtaining a correct knowledge of the twenty-four other tattvas and by properly discriminating the purusha from prakriti and its products. It regards the whole universe as a develop- ment of this innate principle called prakriti, while the purusha is altogether passive and simply a looker on, untainted, unaffect- ed, pure and perfect. It agrees with the Vedanta in being synthetical and differs from the analytical Nyaya or Vaiseshika, but its great point of divergence from the Vedanta is that it maintains two principles which the Vedanta disapproves and that it does not admit God as the creator and controller of the uni- verse which the Vedanta affirms. 
+ Yaga: The system of practical philosophy attributed to Pantanjali who appeared to have given it first a systematised form, which is only another form of the sankhya philosophy though practically reckoned as a separate system and differs from it in admitting a twenty fifth principle, God. The chief aim of this philosophy is to teach the means by which the indi- vidual soul jiva may be completely united with the supreme spirit by isolation from matter and thus secure absolution; and abstract meditation is laid down as the chief means of securing this end. The word yoga from the universality of the science came to be

future fruition). Similarly the expiatory karma (Prayas- chitta) is of two kinds; one is chāndrāyana and such other penances destructive of sins already committed, the other, sandhya (the morning, noon and evening prayers), worship and such other (obligatory karmas). 
17-18. Of these, injury and other detrimental karmas (apaya), building temple and other kamyakarmas (perform- ed for some particular object and with a view to future frui- tion, Sankhya and other expedient karmas (upaya) and also Chandrayana and other expiatory karmas (prāyaschitta)– all these, one shall not, at any time practice. 
19-20. Those karmas (rites) which are mentioned as remedying future evil, such as sandhya (the morning, noon and evening prayers), archana (worship) panchayagua* (the five sacrifices) and such others as are honoured by those that are desirous of freedom (mumukshus), and the occasional one's such as, the oblation consisting of first fruits at the end of the rainy season (āgrāvana), the parting of the hair (Simantonnayana) &c., and also such others as consecrating the fire (agnyadhana),-all these, aught to be done by the twice-born (dojas) if they have a right to them. But those Karmas that are known as the forbidden (nishiddha), those done for some gain (Kamya) and those that are the means for securing some future fruition (upaya), these others one shall not perform. 
applied to any practical science or method for realising an ideal; thence to a portion or even a member of it. In this sense is affixed to several other words, where it indicates the method of leading to the ideal indicated on. 
* Panchayagna: The five devotional acts or worships which every house holder, especially the twice-born, has to perform every day. They are Bhutayagna, Manushya-yajna, Pitriyajna, Devayajna, and Brahma-yajna which are collectively called the five great sacrifices.' 
Prapanna parijata.

21. Should an occasion arise, one shall perform that prayaschitta (expiatory rite) which is specially prescribed to a Prapanna by Lakshmi in Lakshmitantra. 
22. This (special) teaching of the Pancharatra- Sastras being observed only once, shall surely enable a man to cross Samsara. In case of his being attached to the expedient and detrimental Karmas (upayapaya) he loses in faith or fixity. 
23. 
When there is an overflow of evil then alone shall one perform an expiatory rite (prayaschitta). This prayas- chitta is that special one that he shall again seek refuge with God.' Even in the case of accepting the expediency of beneficial rites, the same is the remedy, 
. 24. When an occasion for prayaschitta arises, what- ever may be the sin that gave rise to it, one shall seek re- fuge with me alone, the Consort of the God of gods. 
25. Therefore whatever may be the sin of a Prapanna brought on either by negligence or by intention-all these, this Saranagati (refuge-seeking) aloue removes at once. 
26. That fool who, even knowing the loss of position in detrimental rites (apaya) (willfully) performs them,-to him there shall be only the enjoyment of those karmas and no atonement even by this (saranagati). 
27. From the pride that one is a l'rapanna one shall not commit excess of sins. The fool, even while being conscious of performing detrimental karmas, falls down. 
28. The wise do not at all commit (such deeds) 1f through ignorance or mistake, they do any, getting a lucid state of mind they burn them all with the fire of knowledge. 
29-80. In this connection Bhagavan Krishna says to the attentive Arjuna :- 
"As a fire well-kindled reduces the fuel to ashes so, to ashes, the fire of knowledge reduces all actions ?"

The Brahmavadın. 
31. To the sages whose minds are purified by the trust in the knowledge of God, the knowledge of God men- tioned in the Sastras, is the atonemen.t for all the sins. committed by them. 
32. Only as much accomplishment there is to a person as the degree of faith in him. The efficacy of faith cannot be measured as 'thus much'. 
33. An intelligent man shall always obey the approved customs mentioned in the Vedas. With reference to the transgression of the Vedic course of conduct what is said in the Pancharatra-sastras is as follows:- 
34-35. "For the non-lapse of dharmas, for the pre- servation of the race, for the protection of the people, for the establishment of the moral-laws (or fixity of usages), for the pleasure of myself and Vishnu, the God of gods and the Wielder of the bow saranga, an intelligent man shall not transgress the Vedic usage even mentally. 
36-37. "As the favourite of a king destroying a channel inaugurated by the king, even though he be indif- ferent towards it-a channel which is of public use, which is beautiful and which sustains the growth of many plants- shall be impaled on a pike, so a person having violated the usage established by the Vedas, even though he be dear to Me ceases to be my beloved on account of the transgression of My command. 
38-39. With reference to these karmas, a wise man shall give up the idea of perceiving in them the means to an end. But remaining in his own caste and order of life, suitably to place and time he shall perform only those karmas agreeable to God that have been specially prescri- bed to him,

CHAPTER IX. 
ON THE KARMAS THAT OUGHT TO BE RENOUNCED. 
1. Of the worldly and Vedic karmas those that ought to be renounced by the Prapannas are here described. One shall always shun what is incongruent with one's own status, place and time. 
2. What is particularly mentioned by Mann and others as contrary to caste and order of life and what is said in the Pancharatra-sastra as inconsistent with one's own duty, shall one not perform. 
3-4. The reverential going from left to right, keeping the object of circumambulation to the right, round a place where the four roads meet, a tree, an auspicious object and such other acts which are destructive of sins to men, all those acts that are sanctioned by the general sastras but are con- trary to the special ones, and the karmas yielding the enjoy- ments of both the worlds i. e. performed for some particular worldly object and future fruition (kamya), all these the prince of men devoted to one object only (parame- kanti) shall not do, as also wearing marks and other tokens which are prescribed in the general sastras but are contrary (to the practices of a Vaishnava). 
5.. Singing, dancing &c, which are enjoined by the special Agama-sastra-all these shall a Vaishnava do. Yama and Sounaka have thus declared :- 
- 
6. "O the purest of men! except the singing of God, no other song of words should be sung by a Brahmin. Therefore (if other songs are sung) sin has been committed by you." 

318 
 
7. Singing of Vishnu, composing songs on Hin and dancing, O Brahmin! ought to be specially done by those born of the Brahmin caste, like the obligatory karmas (Nitya Karma). 
8. The birds of great sins which inhabit the bodies of men who dance in the presence of God are scared away by the clapping of hands &c. 
9. A Vaishnava shall not give up the mark of the disc of Vishnu and such other tokens which are mentioned in the special sastras, on account of the superiority of a special rule. 
10-11. Owing to sparseness of followers in the world, owing to the quality of being an easy means, from the weigh- tiness of the result and also from construing otherwise the authorities (for prapatti) with the help of specious reasoning, some disregard the expediency of Prapatti for the accom- plishment of freedom. 
12. They who are wicked and foolish, are deemed the vilest of men. Robbed of their knowledge by Maya (illu- sion) they have betaken themselves to demoniac nature. 
13. Those sinners at the time of birth whom-Vishnu satva shall not glance at, but Brahma or Rudra shall look at as being covered with passion or darkness, with such one shall not speak. For, with the unrighteous, one shall not have any intercourse whatever. 
14. Manu has said the Sastras of the vain questioners of cause to be vulgar and forbids intercourse with them even by mere speech. 
15. Those smritis which are contrary to the Vedas, and those low cults which are sophistical, all these are use- less after death; therefore, indeed, they are considered as resting in darkness (low ideas). 
16. One shall not honor even by speech heretics who practise impious acts, who are impostors in cat-like obser-

vance, crane.t 

319 
and who are religious hypocrites behaving like the 
17. A Prapanna shall not practise any such (karmas) acts whatsoever by which bindrance arises to Prapatti. 
18-21. Honoring deities other than God except in the established neages of daily work, following other means than Prapatti, and malice towards holy men, too much indulgence in sensual objects, reviling and otherwise acting in any such way towards Lakshmi, the Lord of Lakshmi and their attendants, and remorseless conduct as long as the body exists, egregious sins devoid of prayaschitta-all such acts also a Prapanna shall not do. 
12. In case there is any connection with these to the good, and if repentence sets in, they shall, then, perform prayaschitta both privately and publicly. 
23. To a repentent Prapanna there is authorisation to prayaschitta only in private. Thus has Lakshmi said to the 
• Baidalavrata. "Catlike observance," concealing one's malice or evil designs under the garb of piety or virtue. The allusion is to a characterístic story of a cat which after infusing confidence into the rate by a show of assumed piety, tries to destroy them by carefully preying on the stray ones. Manu gives the follow- ing definition of a Baidalavratika. "One who vaunts his piety by carrying the flag of righteousness, who is always malicious and who is a religious hypocrite, deceiver of the world, fierce as a beast and a traducer of all, is known as a Baidalavratika." 
+ Bakavritti. "Cranelike conduct,' religious hypocrisy. The reference is to the act of a crane which under the pretence of sleep watches the fish passing through an acqueduct till a big one passes when it suddenly pounces upon it. Manu defines a Bako- vratika thus :--" He is a dvija (twice-born) acting like the crane who (like a yogi) has a downward look, who is false and eruel, who is always bent on securing his own interest who is rogue and who is falsely modest. 

320 
questioning Indra. 
The Brahmaradin. 
24. In the ways of yore secrecy has been pointed out. to a Prapanna. Implying the same idea the words of Para- 
sara are as follow. 
25. "To a person in whom repentence sets in when a sin is committed, the remembering of God alone is mention- ed as the highest atonement (prayaschitta)." 
26. "O Maitreya! Swayambhu and other sages have- spoken of prayaschitta to be of the same degree as the sin (proportionate to), a severe one for a great sin and a light one for a slight sin." 
27. 
"All prayaschittas are of the nature of austerity (tapas) and rite (karma). Of all of them the constant re- membering of Krishna (God) is the highest." 
28. That those rites which are done in a sacrifice either from negligence or from deviation from the right course become perfect by the remembering alone of God, is the teaching of the Srutis. 
29. To him who is devoted to the meditation on God, expiatory rites (Kriyas) end with the setting in of that meditation; but to a foolish unbeliever those of ten year's duration are enjoined. 
80. As the expiatory rites which ought to be done (kartavya) are prescribed to be of twelve years duration only to an atheist, by thus distinguishing the subject, there carr be no confusion of the 'severe one' and the 'light one.' 
31. "The purification that arises to a soul (Kshetrajna) from the knowledge of Isvara (the Lord) is considered the highest." By Yajnavalkya who thus has said, is also des- cribed the purification of the soul that arises from a know- ledge of the relation of the appropriated and the appropriator (seshaseshi) that exists between the Soul and God (Atman and Iswara). 
32. Even though a person be much addicted to sin, 
 
Prapannaparijuta. 
321 
meditating on God for a moment he becomes anew an asce- tie (lapasvin) and the purifier of the pure who sanctify by their presence those persons that sit with them in the same row to dine (panktipavana). 
33. Whether he be holy or unholy or even has fallen into all sorts of undesirable states of life, that person who shall think of God, becomes pure both internally and exter- nally. 
34. To such men, meditators on God, mentioned by Sounaka and others who feel repentence when a sin is com- mitted, their expiatory rites end with the setting in of that meditation (ie., on God). 
85. A Vaishnava, only giving up association with thos that are devoted to other deities than God and also with those that are devoted to other means than Prapatti, shall live with the prapannas. 
36. A virtuous man (sadhu) shall not resort to a fool, nor a guru shall teach a fool. For, he who betakes himself to an ignorant person enters the darkness; and the know- ledge that is given to a fool is seed sown in a barren, saline soil. 
87. The guru and the disciple shall not at anytime bear malice towards each other. Of these he who is malici- ously inclined falls from the path of freedom. 
38-39. No person shall have recourse to God (Hari) with a mantra uninstructed by a guru. From cupidity a disciple shall not reproach a righteous guru. An intelli- gent man shall not appropriate anything without offering it to his guru. A good Vaishnava shall relinquish all those that hate his guru. 
40-41. In a temple of Vishnu a Prapanna shall not commit spitting, and such other defilement; shall not wash his feet; nor walk between God and the altar; nor enter God's temple by any passage which is not intended as a regular 

322 
door way. 
The Brahmaradin, 
42-43. A Vaishnava shall never enter clothed in a blanket of blackwool; nor in a temple of Vishnu perform any other work but the lighting of lamps &c, the knitting of garlands and such other services of God. 
44. He shall not salute any other deity, nor contem- plate any other deity; he shall not go up into any other temple nor enter any other sanctuary. 
45. In the Varahapurana thirtytwo offences against God are especially considered. A Vaishnava shall abstain from them. 46. A Vaishnava shall not get, on his own behalf per- fumes, flowers,also clothes, jewels, animals, houses and other objects of enjoyment. 
47. The idea of subserviency should not be entertain- ed in one's own sons &c, who are the manifestations of the glory of God (Vishnu). For a wise man shall always shun the feeling of meum (mamata). 
48. An Ekanti (one who is devoted to one object) should not be designated with the appellations of Village, family &c, but he should be called by the names of Vishnu. For, his all is that Vishnu. 
49. 
As of a river which has entered into the ocean all names are but the names of that ocean, so of an Ekanti who has completely surrendered himself to Vishnu. 
50. He shall not also do crossing the shadows of the holy sages and such other acts. He shall always remain with spiritual men and shall avoid dispute with them. 
51. The Vishvaksena Samhita of Pancharatra Agama thus enjoins a Prapanna. He shall not evince taste for an unvaishnavic look or love to an unrighteous sastra. 
52-53. He shall not take a false oath, nor consult (astrologers &c.) for good and evil. With base mantras he shall not effect extraction of poison, exorcism of devils and other evil spirits and the cure of all diseases. 
 
Prapannaparijala. 
323 
54. He shall not wear matted tresses, also he shall not wear ashes. He shall give up for life all heterodox marks. 
55. My idea is that wherever the Vaishnavic course of conduct approved of by wise men is in vogue, in any such place shall he always live and not elsewhere. 
56. Any how for the sake of livelihood one shall not fol- low the ways of the world. Occupying that profession which is to the approval of the good and is consistent with place and time, he shall not, out of temptation, resort to vulgar means. 
57-58. Bhagavan Vyasa has, in this connection, pointed out what ought to be rejected by the virtuous :- 
"There is no moksha to him who takes delight in the science of words (sabda sastra) and also to him who is fond of fine habitation; not to him who is exclusively devoted to food and clothing; nay to him who is bent on captivating the minds of people. But to him who is of a retiring dis- position, of firm practice, who has withdrawn from the plea- sures of the senses, whose mind is devoted to the knowledge of the Supreme Spirit, and who is always harmless, moksha is certain." 
59. He shall not welcome death, he shall not welcome life. As the hireling his wage, so shall he abide his time. 
60. Mostly those people who have not accomplished the object of their lives shrink from death; but those who have accomplished their objects await death like a welcome guest. 
61. A person shall never pray to Vishnu (God) for any other reward than love (Bhakti) and knowledge (gnana) at his feet; for, by so praying he is sure to go to ruin. 
62. If an offence is given to a sage either from negli- gence or from intention, repentant one shall seek him alone for forgivness, otherwise there will be no palliation. 
63. Even in the case of an offence againist God this expiation is unsurpassed. A wise man shall avoid all carnality. 
 
324 
The Brahmavadın. 
64. Therefore shall a wise man completely renounce the objects of the senses like poison. An ignorant is called a vulgar man of the world but a wise man, a Vaishnava. 
65. A wise man shall not do anything with any un- wise man. 
This has been said by the Lord in the Pancha- ratra Sastra, also by Mana and others. 
66-67. Therefore a pious Vaishnava skall shun con- tact with a vulgar man of the world. Intermingling is said to be of eight kinds which ought not to be held with an- blushing sensualists;-occupying one bed, one seat, sitting in one row with other people, using one pot, intermixing cooked food, conducting sacrificial rites, teaching the Vedas, intermarriage and interdining. 
68. Sins enter into men by conversation, touch and the manner of sleeping, by sitting and lying down together, by the functions of a priest and of an instructor, and by inter- marriage. 
69. Through conducting sacrifices, through reaching the Veda and learning them, through lying down, sitting and sleeping together, having associated with a fallen man for a year one falls. 
70. The delineation of this conmmingting (sankara) by Brihaspati and, Manu is diverse. But the power of con- ducting sacrifices and such other intercourses to cause degra dation is immediate. 
71. To the high souled Vaishnavas who are devoted to the knowledge of self-surrender (Nyasavidya) the praise of the low sensualists is declared to be a censure and their censure, praise. 
72–73. © worldlings! henceforth you are yourselves and we are ourselves. You are devoted to worldly prosperity and sensual enjoyments and we are devoted to Narayana (God). There can be no intercourse whatever between you and us. You are servants of senses but we are servants of (God) Vishnu.

(Continued from page 334.) 
CHAPTER X. 
ON THE DAWN OF FRUITION. 
1. Vishnu overcome with intense love goes after those that have thus taken refuge with the feet of Vishnu and are disignated His life (Prana). 
2. That the wise man is myself, is my creed'. So has been said by the Lord Himself. The high-souled person who, at the end of many deaths and births, by good fortune resorts to Vishnu knowing that he is the all, is very difficult to be met with. 
3. It has been said by Bhagavan Vishnu in the Pan- charatra Sastra that the satisfaction of a Prapanna in having achieved his object is unsurpassed love to God and the consciousness of His distinction from all. 
4-5. He who adopting Vishnu as the means accom- plishes another object is said to be the lowest. He who adopting other means aims at the attainment of Vishnu is said to be mediocre. He who adopting the pair of Madhava's feet as the means attains the feet of Madhava (God) is the best qualified, and has here, in this birth accomplished his object. 
6. God of his own accord receives on His head all the worship which are made by men whose minds are devoted to one object. 
7. Even an atom of offering given with love by the bhaktas becomes very great to me, and that offered by a 

• 
380 
The Brahmavallin. 
non-bhakta, however much it be, does not bring about my satisfaction. 
8. Here.the word bhakta in its chief significance ulti- mately points to a Prapanna. In his own samhita (Vishvak- senasamhita) the leader of the hosts (senesa) has said as follows:-- 
9-10. By the word bhakti copious seva (devoted service) is mentioned by the sages; and seva is entering into a state of utter lowliness towards one's Lord. Therefore the act of taking pleasure solely in the service of the Supreme is called Bhakti. 
11-12. Some good men who have their sole refuge in destitution of means, but again are highly fortunate and have chosen Lakshmi as the mediatrix and are desirous of attaining Me alone who is united with Sri, having thus taken shelter with Me, reach me alone. 
13. He who does My werk, who has no being higher than me, who is free from sorrow, fear and fatigue and who is without any support, without any desire, without any attachment to the external world and without egotism, having taken refuge with Me alone shall cross the ocean of 
samsara. 
14. Those that are devoted to good works, that are pure and learned in sankhyayoga (the path of knowledge), are not worth even a tenmillomth part of him who is staid in refuge-seeking. 
15. And-te a person who has acquired the means (of Prapatti), the non-clinging and destruction of subsequent and antecedent aghas (actions of bondage) which are of the nature of merit (punya) and demerit (papa), shall happen. 
16-17. Properly, all other antecedent aghas of a proud prapanna (dripta), except those that are fit to be enjoyed in the body already begun, desist; and there shall be no clinging of all other aghas except those only that are 


381 
intentional, principal, persisting till the decay of the body and are devoid of repentence. 
18-19. This import has been specially declared by Bhagavan Vishnu. 
"Bhakti as the means of accomplishing one's desired object (upayabhakti) is the destroyer of all aghas excepting those that have begun to work (prārabdha) ; but bhakti as the end to reach (sadhya-bhakti) which is greater, is the destroyer even of the aghas that have commenced to work. 
20. Bhakti-yoga with all its auxiliary parts is here called upaya-bhakti (bhakti as a means). It shall not destroy the aghas begun (prarabdha) which is verily the cause of many births. 
21. 
44 
Prapatti which is of the nature of moksha is called sadhya-bhakti (bhakti as an end). This one too which is higher, shall destroy even the aghas already begun of the afflicted Prapannas (artas), but it shall not destroy the aglas of a proad Prapanna which are to be enjoyed in the body already possessed. 
22. This is what has been said here :-If there is liberation from prarabdhakarma owing to the enjoyment of births, then with the help of bhakti-yoga shall one be freed. 
23-24. "From karma which is the root of sorrow I shall liberate you, grieve not." As it has been thus said by the Lord, also on account of the feeling of grief for the body, there shall be liberation forthwith to an arta-prapan- na (the afflicted or the unhappy prapanna); for prapatti is higher (than Bhakti-yoga). 
25. But a dripta (a proud-prapanna), as he of his own accord does not feel grief on account of the body posses- sed (prarabdha), is liberated at the end of the body. This is the determination of their time of liberation.

heart, with ease bursting open the hundred and oneth tubular organ of the body (sushumna) and through it immediately rising above, reaching those employed to convey to the other world (ātivåhikas) being conducted by them who have kindness to show at every step, through the different stages of the path of light (archirādi), and owing to the con- tact of the hand of the superhuman being (amānava) leaving the subtle body (Sūkskmadeha), mentally crossing the river Viraja (devoid of passion) and marked with holy sandal and other perfumes of Brahman, shall attain, in order, (the several states of assimilation with God), living in the same heaven (Salokya), then having the sameness of form (Sarupya) and living in proximity (Samipya) and finally shall completely obtain intimate union with Brahman (Sayujya), moving about from world to world and pursuing all desires taking form at will, along with the eternals (Suris) he always does the service of chanting Samaveda. 
31. Or else, as if not brooking the delay caused by the regular path (archiradimarga), that God speedily takes away at will a Prapanna is also taught by the Srutis. 
32. The Lord in the shape of the great Varaha who is eminent among the mighty, has spoken to His attentive consort, Bhumi, words bearing on this subject as 
follows:- 
33-34. "That person who thinks of me, the omnipre- sent and the unborn, when his mind is in a state of calmness, his body in a state of harmony of the humours, him, I after- wards think of; my devotee (bhakta) who is at the point of death like a stock or stone and lead him to the final goal.” 
35-43. At any time whatever on account of the har- mony of wind and other humours of the body due to the absence of disease when calmness of mind exists, if any man whatever thinks of me who am the great ocean of lordship, excellence of disposition, affection and other good qualities 
 

383 
kindled by Lakshmi, and who am Narayana, the Omni- present, the unborn and the possessor of body at will,-Me, if he thinks of even once saying 'O Narayana, than whom there is no other resort, I have taken refuge with Thy feet', Of my own accord I then think of him who is free from obstruc- tion by other means, who remains steady in that state and who, when death approaches, is like a block of wood or stone, that is, like wood is devoid of the activity of mind in his own body, who has consciousness only when awakened by others but afterwards has an impaired mind, who him- self is devoid of the thought of his own good and like his own self by others also-I, the soul of support of my followers, am that Purusha (Person) who, while his depen- dents are asleep, remaining steady and bringing into exist- ence all the objects of their desire, is awake for the ful- filment of them. And by way of making known the flow of my grace, without the path of the light (archiradi) I shall take this person who is worthy of enjoying my enjoyments, to the highest region, mounting him without any hindrance as much as desired on the shoulder of Garutman." 
44. The servents of Yama with their nooses, being afraid, speedily fall off from the side of a Prapanna who is possessed of such glory. 
45. As has been said by Parasara and Suka this man is the servant of none whatever :- 
"Seeing his own functionary noose in hand, Yama, in- deed, whispers in his ear, shun those that have taken refuge with Madhusudana, for I am the master only of other men and not of the Vishnavas." 
46. "O King! that person who has completely sought refuge with the Teacher of the world (Lokaguru), Narayana, the worthy object of resort, is neither a servant nor a debtor of the gods, the sages, the elementals, men and the divine manes (Pitris).” 
 
334 
 
47. A great bridge over the milky ocean of the prac- tices of Prapannas has been built by bringing together the the poundings of the mountains of Vedanta, Smriti, and such important teachings of great sages and the Pancharatra. Those that wish to reach quick the extremity of the ocean of Samsara by this route, being released by the store of ante- cedent and subsequent (Purvottara) sinful Karmas, they are considered to be completely freed. 
48. Wise men who are fearless therefore get into the boat of Nyasa (self-surrender) which is without any hole and is able to go to the end, which has for the base-plank the eons- ciousness arising out of the feeling of wretchedness, which is fastened by the nail of faith, which obeys the pull of the tether (Bandanarajyu) of prayer, which has the mast of self-surrender (Nekshepa) and which enables embodied be- ings to cross the ocean of Samsara. 
49. The work known as Prapannaparijata has beer proclaimed on earth-a work where the desires of the virtuous are met with from all sides.

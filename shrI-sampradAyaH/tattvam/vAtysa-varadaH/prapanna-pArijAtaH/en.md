56. Any how for the sake of livelihood one shall not fol- low the ways of the world. Occupying that profession which is to the approval of the good and is consistent with place and time, he shall not, out of temptation, resort to vulgar means. 
57-58. Bhagavan Vyasa has, in this connection, pointed out what ought to be rejected by the virtuous :- 
"There is no moksha to him who takes delight in the science of words (sabda sastra) and also to him who is fond of fine habitation; not to him who is exclusively devoted to food and clothing; nay to him who is bent on captivating the minds of people. But to him who is of a retiring dis- position, of firm practice, who has withdrawn from the plea- sures of the senses, whose mind is devoted to the knowledge of the Supreme Spirit, and who is always harmless, moksha is certain." 
59. He shall not welcome death, he shall not welcome life. As the hireling his wage, so shall he abide his time. 
60. Mostly those people who have not accomplished the object of their lives shrink from death; but those who have accomplished their objects await death like a welcome guest. 
61. A person shall never pray to Vishnu (God) for any other reward than love (Bhakti) and knowledge (gnana) at his feet; for, by so praying he is sure to go to ruin. 
62. If an offence is given to a sage either from negli- gence or from intention, repentant one shall seek him alone for forgivness, otherwise there will be no palliation. 
63. Even in the case of an offence againist God this expiation is unsurpassed. A wise man shall avoid all carnality.

64. Therefore shall a wise man completely renounce the objects of the senses like poison. An ignorant is called a vulgar man of the world but a wise man, a Vaishnava. 
65. A wise man shall not do anything with any un- wise man. 
This has been said by the Lord in the Pancha- ratra Sastra, also by Mana and others. 
66-67. Therefore a pious Vaishnava skall shun con- tact with a vulgar man of the world. Intermingling is said to be of eight kinds which ought not to be held with an- blushing sensualists;-occupying one bed, one seat, sitting in one row with other people, using one pot, intermixing cooked food, conducting sacrificial rites, teaching the Vedas, intermarriage and interdining. 
68. Sins enter into men by conversation, touch and the manner of sleeping, by sitting and lying down together, by the functions of a priest and of an instructor, and by inter- marriage. 
69. Through conducting sacrifices, through reaching the Veda and learning them, through lying down, sitting and sleeping together, having associated with a fallen man for a year one falls. 
70. The delineation of this conmmingting (sankara) by Brihaspati and, Manu is diverse. But the power of con- ducting sacrifices and such other intercourses to cause degra dation is immediate. 
71. To the high souled Vaishnavas who are devoted to the knowledge of self-surrender (Nyasavidya) the praise of the low sensualists is declared to be a censure and their censure, praise. 
72–73. © worldlings! henceforth you are yourselves and we are ourselves. You are devoted to worldly prosperity and sensual enjoyments and we are devoted to Narayana (God). There can be no intercourse whatever between you and us. You are servants of senses but we are servants of (God) Vishnu.

CHAPTER X. 
ON THE DAWN OF FRUITION. 
1. Vishnu overcome with intense love goes after those that have thus taken refuge with the feet of Vishnu and are disignated His life (Prana). 
2. That the wise man is myself, is my creed'. So has been said by the Lord Himself. The high-souled person who, at the end of many deaths and births, by good fortune resorts to Vishnu knowing that he is the all, is very difficult to be met with. 
3. It has been said by Bhagavan Vishnu in the Pan- charatra Sastra that the satisfaction of a Prapanna in having achieved his object is unsurpassed love to God and the consciousness of His distinction from all. 
4-5. He who adopting Vishnu as the means accom- plishes another object is said to be the lowest. He who adopting other means aims at the attainment of Vishnu is said to be mediocre. He who adopting the pair of Madhava's feet as the means attains the feet of Madhava (God) is the best qualified, and has here, in this birth accomplished his object. 
6. God of his own accord receives on His head all the worship which are made by men whose minds are devoted to one object. 
7. Even an atom of offering given with love by the bhaktas becomes very great to me, and that offered by a

non-bhakta, however much it be, does not bring about my satisfaction. 
8. Here.the word bhakta in its chief significance ulti- mately points to a Prapanna. In his own samhita (Vishvak- senasamhita) the leader of the hosts (senesa) has said as follows:-- 
9-10. By the word bhakti copious seva (devoted service) is mentioned by the sages; and seva is entering into a state of utter lowliness towards one's Lord. Therefore the act of taking pleasure solely in the service of the Supreme is called Bhakti. 
11-12. Some good men who have their sole refuge in destitution of means, but again are highly fortunate and have chosen Lakshmi as the mediatrix and are desirous of attaining Me alone who is united with Sri, having thus taken shelter with Me, reach me alone. 
13. He who does My werk, who has no being higher than me, who is free from sorrow, fear and fatigue and who is without any support, without any desire, without any attachment to the external world and without egotism, having taken refuge with Me alone shall cross the ocean of 
samsara. 
14. Those that are devoted to good works, that are pure and learned in sankhyayoga (the path of knowledge), are not worth even a tenmillomth part of him who is staid in refuge-seeking. 
15. And-te a person who has acquired the means (of Prapatti), the non-clinging and destruction of subsequent and antecedent aghas (actions of bondage) which are of the nature of merit (punya) and demerit (papa), shall happen. 
16-17. Properly, all other antecedent aghas of a proud prapanna (dripta), except those that are fit to be enjoyed in the body already begun, desist; and there shall be no clinging of all other aghas except those only that are 


381 
intentional, principal, persisting till the decay of the body and are devoid of repentence. 
18-19. This import has been specially declared by Bhagavan Vishnu. 
"Bhakti as the means of accomplishing one's desired object (upayabhakti) is the destroyer of all aghas excepting those that have begun to work (prārabdha) ; but bhakti as the end to reach (sadhya-bhakti) which is greater, is the destroyer even of the aghas that have commenced to work. 
20. Bhakti-yoga with all its auxiliary parts is here called upaya-bhakti (bhakti as a means). It shall not destroy the aghas begun (prarabdha) which is verily the cause of many births. 
21. 
44 
Prapatti which is of the nature of moksha is called sadhya-bhakti (bhakti as an end). This one too which is higher, shall destroy even the aghas already begun of the afflicted Prapannas (artas), but it shall not destroy the aglas of a proad Prapanna which are to be enjoyed in the body already possessed. 
22. This is what has been said here :-If there is liberation from prarabdhakarma owing to the enjoyment of births, then with the help of bhakti-yoga shall one be freed. 
23-24. "From karma which is the root of sorrow I shall liberate you, grieve not." As it has been thus said by the Lord, also on account of the feeling of grief for the body, there shall be liberation forthwith to an arta-prapan- na (the afflicted or the unhappy prapanna); for prapatti is higher (than Bhakti-yoga). 
25. But a dripta (a proud-prapanna), as he of his own accord does not feel grief on account of the body posses- sed (prarabdha), is liberated at the end of the body. This is the determination of their time of liberation.

heart, with ease bursting open the hundred and oneth tubular organ of the body (sushumna) and through it immediately rising above, reaching those employed to convey to the other world (ātivåhikas) being conducted by them who have kindness to show at every step, through the different stages of the path of light (archirādi), and owing to the con- tact of the hand of the superhuman being (amānava) leaving the subtle body (Sūkskmadeha), mentally crossing the river Viraja (devoid of passion) and marked with holy sandal and other perfumes of Brahman, shall attain, in order, (the several states of assimilation with God), living in the same heaven (Salokya), then having the sameness of form (Sarupya) and living in proximity (Samipya) and finally shall completely obtain intimate union with Brahman (Sayujya), moving about from world to world and pursuing all desires taking form at will, along with the eternals (Suris) he always does the service of chanting Samaveda. 
31. Or else, as if not brooking the delay caused by the regular path (archiradimarga), that God speedily takes away at will a Prapanna is also taught by the Srutis. 
32. The Lord in the shape of the great Varaha who is eminent among the mighty, has spoken to His attentive consort, Bhumi, words bearing on this subject as 
follows:- 
33-34. "That person who thinks of me, the omnipre- sent and the unborn, when his mind is in a state of calmness, his body in a state of harmony of the humours, him, I after- wards think of; my devotee (bhakta) who is at the point of death like a stock or stone and lead him to the final goal.” 
35-43. At any time whatever on account of the har- mony of wind and other humours of the body due to the absence of disease when calmness of mind exists, if any man whatever thinks of me who am the great ocean of lordship, excellence of disposition, affection and other good qualities 
 

383 
kindled by Lakshmi, and who am Narayana, the Omni- present, the unborn and the possessor of body at will,-Me, if he thinks of even once saying 'O Narayana, than whom there is no other resort, I have taken refuge with Thy feet', Of my own accord I then think of him who is free from obstruc- tion by other means, who remains steady in that state and who, when death approaches, is like a block of wood or stone, that is, like wood is devoid of the activity of mind in his own body, who has consciousness only when awakened by others but afterwards has an impaired mind, who him- self is devoid of the thought of his own good and like his own self by others also-I, the soul of support of my followers, am that Purusha (Person) who, while his depen- dents are asleep, remaining steady and bringing into exist- ence all the objects of their desire, is awake for the ful- filment of them. And by way of making known the flow of my grace, without the path of the light (archiradi) I shall take this person who is worthy of enjoying my enjoyments, to the highest region, mounting him without any hindrance as much as desired on the shoulder of Garutman." 
44. The servents of Yama with their nooses, being afraid, speedily fall off from the side of a Prapanna who is possessed of such glory. 
45. As has been said by Parasara and Suka this man is the servant of none whatever :- 
"Seeing his own functionary noose in hand, Yama, in- deed, whispers in his ear, shun those that have taken refuge with Madhusudana, for I am the master only of other men and not of the Vishnavas." 
46. "O King! that person who has completely sought refuge with the Teacher of the world (Lokaguru), Narayana, the worthy object of resort, is neither a servant nor a debtor of the gods, the sages, the elementals, men and the divine manes (Pitris).”

47. A great bridge over the milky ocean of the prac- tices of Prapannas has been built by bringing together the the poundings of the mountains of Vedanta, Smriti, and such important teachings of great sages and the Pancharatra. Those that wish to reach quick the extremity of the ocean of Samsara by this route, being released by the store of ante- cedent and subsequent (Purvottara) sinful Karmas, they are considered to be completely freed. 
48. Wise men who are fearless therefore get into the boat of Nyasa (self-surrender) which is without any hole and is able to go to the end, which has for the base-plank the eons- ciousness arising out of the feeling of wretchedness, which is fastened by the nail of faith, which obeys the pull of the tether (Bandanarajyu) of prayer, which has the mast of self-surrender (Nekshepa) and which enables embodied be- ings to cross the ocean of Samsara. 
49. The work known as Prapannaparijata has beer proclaimed on earth-a work where the desires of the virtuous are met with from all sides.

Prapatti which is of the nature of moksha is called sadhya-bhakti (bhakti as an end). This one too which is higher, shall destroy even the aghas already begun of the afflicted Prapannas (artas), but it shall not destroy the aglas of a proad Prapanna which are to be enjoyed in the body already possessed. 
22. This is what has been said here :-If there is liberation from prarabdhakarma owing to the enjoyment of births, then with the help of bhakti-yoga shall one be freed. 
23-24. "From karma which is the root of sorrow I shall liberate you, grieve not." As it has been thus said by the Lord, also on account of the feeling of grief for the body, there shall be liberation forthwith to an arta-prapan- na (the afflicted or the unhappy prapanna); for prapatti is higher (than Bhakti-yoga). 
25. But a dripta (a proud-prapanna), as he of his own accord does not feel grief on account of the body posses- sed (prarabdha), is liberated at the end of the body. This is the determination of their time of liberation.

heart, with ease bursting open the hundred and oneth tubular organ of the body (sushumna) and through it immediately rising above, reaching those employed to convey to the other world (ātivåhikas) being conducted by them who have kindness to show at every step, through the different stages of the path of light (archirādi), and owing to the con- tact of the hand of the superhuman being (amānava) leaving the subtle body (Sūkskmadeha), mentally crossing the river Viraja (devoid of passion) and marked with holy sandal and other perfumes of Brahman, shall attain, in order, (the several states of assimilation with God), living in the same heaven (Salokya), then having the sameness of form (Sarupya) and living in proximity (Samipya) and finally shall completely obtain intimate union with Brahman (Sayujya), moving about from world to world and pursuing all desires taking form at will, along with the eternals (Suris) he always does the service of chanting Samaveda. 
31. Or else, as if not brooking the delay caused by the regular path (archiradimarga), that God speedily takes away at will a Prapanna is also taught by the Srutis. 
32. The Lord in the shape of the great Varaha who is eminent among the mighty, has spoken to His attentive consort, Bhumi, words bearing on this subject as 
follows:- 
33-34. "That person who thinks of me, the omnipre- sent and the unborn, when his mind is in a state of calmness, his body in a state of harmony of the humours, him, I after- wards think of; my devotee (bhakta) who is at the point of death like a stock or stone and lead him to the final goal.” 
35-43. At any time whatever on account of the har- mony of wind and other humours of the body due to the absence of disease when calmness of mind exists, if any man whatever thinks of me who am the great ocean of lordship, excellence of disposition, affection and other good qualities

kindled by Lakshmi, and who am Narayana, the Omni- present, the unborn and the possessor of body at will,-Me, if he thinks of even once saying 'O Narayana, than whom there is no other resort, I have taken refuge with Thy feet', Of my own accord I then think of him who is free from obstruc- tion by other means, who remains steady in that state and who, when death approaches, is like a block of wood or stone, that is, like wood is devoid of the activity of mind in his own body, who has consciousness only when awakened by others but afterwards has an impaired mind, who him- self is devoid of the thought of his own good and like his own self by others also-I, the soul of support of my followers, am that Purusha (Person) who, while his depen- dents are asleep, remaining steady and bringing into exist- ence all the objects of their desire, is awake for the ful- filment of them. And by way of making known the flow of my grace, without the path of the light (archiradi) I shall take this person who is worthy of enjoying my enjoyments, to the highest region, mounting him without any hindrance as much as desired on the shoulder of Garutman." 
44. The servents of Yama with their nooses, being afraid, speedily fall off from the side of a Prapanna who is possessed of such glory. 
45. As has been said by Parasara and Suka this man is the servant of none whatever :- 
"Seeing his own functionary noose in hand, Yama, in- deed, whispers in his ear, shun those that have taken refuge with Madhusudana, for I am the master only of other men and not of the Vishnavas." 
46. "O King! that person who has completely sought refuge with the Teacher of the world (Lokaguru), Narayana, the worthy object of resort, is neither a servant nor a debtor of the gods, the sages, the elementals, men and the divine manes (Pitris).”

47. A great bridge over the milky ocean of the prac- tices of Prapannas has been built by bringing together the the poundings of the mountains of Vedanta, Smriti, and such important teachings of great sages and the Pancharatra. Those that wish to reach quick the extremity of the ocean of Samsara by this route, being released by the store of ante- cedent and subsequent (Purvottara) sinful Karmas, they are considered to be completely freed. 
48. Wise men who are fearless therefore get into the boat of Nyasa (self-surrender) which is without any hole and is able to go to the end, which has for the base-plank the eons- ciousness arising out of the feeling of wretchedness, which is fastened by the nail of faith, which obeys the pull of the tether (Bandanarajyu) of prayer, which has the mast of self-surrender (Nekshepa) and which enables embodied be- ings to cross the ocean of Samsara. 
49. The work known as Prapannaparijata has beer proclaimed on earth-a work where the desires of the virtuous are met with from all sides.

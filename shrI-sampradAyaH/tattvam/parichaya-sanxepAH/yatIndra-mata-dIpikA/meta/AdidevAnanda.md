## FOREWORD 

SWĀMĪ ĀDIDEVĀNANDA asked me to write a Foreword to his translation of the Yatindramatadipika and I gladly comply with his request for the main reason that the publication of the work is sure to satisfy a long-felt need for a suitable text-book on the Essentials of Visiṣṭādvaita. 

The Yanindramatadipika was composed by Srini- vāsārya, a well-known Visiṣṭādvaitic philosopher who lived in Tirupati, Chittoor District, about the begin- ning of the seventeenth century. It is a compendious exposition of the teachings of Visiṣṭādvaita in its aspects of metaphysics, morals and religion, familiarly known as tattva, hita and puruṣārtha. The book is called Yatindramatadipikā, or the Light of the System of Yatindra, or Śrī Rāmānuja. Śrī Rāmānuja like other Vedantins deduces his philosophy from the Sastra; but gives a comprehensive and synthetic interpretation of it by recognizing the validity of Pañcaratra as the word of God and accepting the equal value of the teachings of Rsis and the Alvārs in the scheme of Ubhaya-vedānta. Viṣiṣṭādvaita accepts the reality of experience in all its levels including dreams and illusions. Its tattva com- prises the three entities, God, souls and matter which however are inseparable. God is defined as the saririn or Self of souls and matter, as these two live and move and have their being in Him. God exists in five forms as the Eternal beyond the perishing world, the infinite in and beyond the finite, the Immanent, and the Incar- nations, historical and permanent. 

vi 

The soul has unique monadic being and is yet a mode deriving its essence from God. It is both substance and attribute. Bhakti and prapatti form the chief means of liberation or mukti. Prapatti as absolute surrender to God is available to all souls. Mukti is the attainment of the Absolute beyond the world of space-time; and then the liberated self enjoys the eternal bliss of Brahman. Spirituality and service go together as the vertical and horizontal ways of expressing love. 

The work faithfully brings out the main teachings of Śrī Rāmānuja as summarized above and it mediates between monism and monotheism. The present work eminently succeeds in its laudable attempt to present a readable account of the text and serves as an excellent introduction to the study of Visiṣṭādvaita. I 

am sure this transaltion which is so far the best in the field will have a good reception.

## PREFACE 

STUDY of Indian philosophy is incomplete without a knowledge of Vedanta in its triple setting-Advaita, Visiṣṭadvaita and Dvaita. For a beginner, the under- standing of Advaita is facilitated by a number of short authoritative manuals now available with accurate translation and other accessories for study. Similar publications on the Visiṣṭadvaita are extremely rare. This book is brought out to remove that want in some 

measure. 

The text printed here is based on the Yarindra- matadipika published by Mr V. K. Ramanujācārya and the other two editions of it brought out in the Benares and Anandaśrama Sanskrit Series respec- tively. It has only once been rendered into English, about forty years ago, by Sri Govindācārya Svämin of Mysore. That edition is now out of print and difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. Though it has been consulted with profit, the present book is con- ceived on a different plan. The translation here has been made as close and faithful to the original as possible. The collated and punctuated Sanskrit text is given on every page to afford easy reference when- ever the verbatim rendering might appear stiff. Copious notes are appended at the end to elucidate points of difficulty and to supply additional information. An Introduction is prefixed to give a conspectus of the work. It is expected the book in this form will meet the needs of the students of philosophy possessing some knowledge of Sanskrit.

I wish to acknowledge my hearty thanks to Dr K. C. Varadachari, Professor of Philosophy, Śrī Venkatesvara College, Tirupati for his valuable help in revising the typescript of the translation; to Pro- fessor P. N. Srinivasachari for his kind Foreword, and to Swāmi Vimalananda for his invaluable counsel and suggestive criticism. I am indebted to Professor R. Rāmānujachari who was kind enough to read through the typescript. And lastly, I would express my gratitude for the constant encouragement and unfailing kindness which I have received in the pre- paration of this work from Swāmī Omkārānanda.

INTRODUCTION 

THE Visiṣṭādvaita of Śrī Rāmānuja was not only a reaction against the dry ritualism of the Mīmāmsakas and the mentalism of atheistic thought which followed the intellectual revolution caused by the Buddha, but also a revival of the theistic Mīmāṁsă as advocated by the Vṛttikara Bodhayana known also as Upavarṣa.1 Vedantic theism did not emerge suddenly in the evolution of the philosophy of religion in India. Besides Bodhāyana, Śrī Rāmānuja in his Vedārthasangraha refers to Ṭaňka, Dramiḍa, Guhadeva, Kapardin and Bharuci, who were great exponents of theistic Vedanta in the days of yore.2) Śrī R. G. Bhandarkar traces the rudiments of theism to a period anterior to the birth of Buddhism and Jainism. The Ghasundi inscription3 referring to the shrine of Sankarṣaṇa and Vasudeva (about 200 B.C.), the Besnagar inscription recording the erection of a Garuda-column in honour of 'Vasu- deva the God of gods' (about 200 B.C.) and the Nānāghāt inscription referring to the worship of Sankarṣaṇa and Vasudeva (100 B.C.) prove the existence of a theistic faith at a very early period. The great contribution of Śrī Rāmānuja is that he has given us for the first time a conception of monotheism in a

The distinctive feature of Visiṣṭadvaita, as com- pared with Advaita on the one hand, and Dvaita on the other hand, is its conception of Reality which, while affirming the ultimate unity of the Absolute, allows (differentiation through its modes (prakāras) without implying any fundamental difference in the Reality itself. Visiṣṭadvaita accepts as ultimate the three entities of matter (acit), individual self (cit) and Iśvara. Matter and individual self are absolutely dependent on Isvara for their existence, the dependence being similar to that of body upon self. The universe forms the body of Isvara, and he is. the Universal Self not only of the unconscious matter but also of the conscious selfs. Body is that which an indwelling self supports and controls for its own services. Similarly matter and selfs, being the body of Isvara, are supported and con- trolled by him for his own purposes. Here we come upon Śrī Rāmānuja's own unique view of the relation of apṛthaksiddhi (inseparability) in which Iśvara stands to the world consisting of matter and selves. The inseparable relation of body to self, in terms of which the relation of the world to Isvara is conceived, brings out clearly the intimate connection that subsists be- tween substance and attribute. Iśvara is substance and the world of matter and selfs form his inseparable attributes. 

This conception of organic unity may be illustrated by the instance of a mango. Here the colour, thea taste, the smell, the flesh, the shell and the fibre which constitute the whole fruit can be distinguished asxi 

being different from one another. 

کا 

Each element 

Yet c in the fruit has its own distinctive attributes. when all these are united, the synthetic whole is re- garded as a mango. What is common to all the dif- ferent parts of the fruit is their inseparable existence. Of the various elements which constitute the mango, we can regard any particular one as the substantive element (viśeşya) and the rest as attributive elements (viseṣaṇas). Likewise the inseparable unity of matter, selfs and Iśvara constitute the Reality in which Isvara, the substantive element, directs and predominates over the attributive elements. Though the world of matter and selfs have a real existence of their own, they are entirely subject to the control of Isvara in all their conditions. Śrī Rāmānuja's system is called Visiṣṭādvaita, since the attributive elements (matter and selfs) and the substantive element. (Iśvara) form a synthetic unity. 

PRAMA AND PRAMĀŅA LEVE 

is vaid 1 

According to Visiṣṭādvaita, pramā (valid know- ledge) should satisfy two conditions. As regards the first condition, pramă should reveal the existence of an object or agree with external reality; the second condition of prama is that it should serve some practical need. 

Prama, therefore, is defined as that which s favours the practical interests of life as they really are.1 The distinctive cause of a particular prama is pramaņa, A cause is considered distinctive or best, since knowledge arises without delay through its agency.

Śrīnivāsa, the author of the present book, following Vedantadesika admits perception, inference and verbal-17 or scriptural testimony as the three ways of knowing. Perception has for its object something always charac- terized by difference, as it is impossible to perceive anything without any difference. Even if someone says that a state of consciousness without any difference is possible, such a determination is always marked by some attribute or other. 

16. 

Perception is of two kinds, determinate and indeter- minate. Indeterminate perception does not mean the apprehension of an object bereft of all distinctions. For, whatever enters into human experience under any circumstance appears with some elements of spatial and structural relations. Even the perception of an object for the first time involves thinking and discrimina- tion as 'this' or 'that'. Visiṣṭādvaita, recognizing the necessity of conceptual factors in any experience defines indeterminate perception as the cognition of an individual for the first time with attributes, configu- ration, etc. When the object of the same class is perceived for the second or the third time with the notion of its generic character, the perception is called determinate. This may be illustrated in the following manner: Two persons-a professor of zoology and his servant-go to a zoological garden. Suddenly they come before an enclosure containing 'marsupial mam- 

mals with strongly developed hindquarters'. The 

pro- fessor, despite his thick eye-glasses, recognizes them at once as kangaroos. His servant, presumably with better eye-sight, stands bewildered without making head or tail of the animal. To the professor it was an 

X111 

apprehension and affirmation of an object as 'this is such', and to his servant it was something indefinite, devoid of specific judgement. Yet the servant, in spite of the absence of specific judgement, perceived some- thing not devoid of class character. The professor's apprehension of the kangaroo may be called determi- nate, while his servant's cognition may be likened to indeterminate perception. 

An analysis of the act of perception involves three factors: (1) the knowing subject, (2) the object, not as something constructed by the mind, but as something relatively independent of it, and (3) the consciousness which issues from the subject and illuminates the object. In the act of perception, the consciousness issues out from the atman through the sense-channels, comes in contact with the object, and reveals it. The consciousness while revealing the object reveals itself also. When the consciousness is directed upon an object through any one of the senses, one becomes aware of that object with its attributes. Since Visiṣṭādvaita does not recognize any attributeless object, the cogni- tive act never excludes a perception of the object with- out attributes. Consequently sense-qualities such as the colour of an object etc., are not constructions of the mind. There is a process of the act of constructing in so far as things with their attributes are presented to the mind. If the attributes of an object are not the construction of the mind, they must have their locus elsewhere. And where else could that be save in the object independent of the mind itself? This theory radically affects the usual conception of the individual self and its consciousness. For, the distinction be- 

xiv 

tween conscious self and object ceases to be a false one, as the very nature of consciousness presupposes the existence of a conscious self as well as objects inde- pendent of the self. 

The awareness of an object not in the form of 'oneness', but with a 'bifurcation of subject and object' has an important metaphysical significance. For, in the highest state of God-realization, when the con- sciousness in its expanded state is directed upon God, the individual is not merged in the Supreme, but be- comes aware of the Supreme. But there is a process of unity in so far as the usual barriers between conscious self and God are annulled. The liberated individual realizes that he is a mode of the Divine. Since the conscious self is aware of 'oneness' with God, there cannot be any absolute unity in which the individu- ality is lost. 

It is in this connection that we come upon the unique conception of jñāna (consciousness), so impor- tant in the psychological implication of knowledge. Jñana is neither material nor spiritual, but immaterial (ajada). It illumines itself and other objects. It always exists for another and never for itself. That is, it can- not know itself, but illumines objects for the conscious subject of whom it is the attribute. Jñana is the attri- bute of Isvara and jīva. It is, therefore, known as dharmabhūtajñāna or attributive consciousness which suggests there is substantive intelligence as well. Isvara and jīvas, while possessing knowledge, are jñāna in the substantive sense. As attributive knowledge, jñāna is eternal and all-pervasive in respect of Isvara, eternals (nityasūris) and liberated selfs. In mundane life, how- 

XV 

ever, it is obscured though it endures in all the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep. 

The epistemological conclusion of Visiṣṭadvaita suggests the trustworthiness of our thoughts and experiences which are of the real. The subject of cognition is as real as cognition and cognitive act. Real objects independent of the mind and corres- ponding to their contents, are alone known. There- fore, reality of objects is reckoned as absolute. This view is known as satkhyāti, since what exists (sat) is cognized. If what exists (sat) alone is cognized, how can we explain illusions in which knowledge does not correspond to things? For instance, apprehension of silver in nacre-silver illusion, water in desert, dreams, illusion of white conch seen as yellow, etc. To under- stand the problem of error, each illusion has to be individually judged on its own merits. Broadly speak- ing, Visiṣṭadvaita justifies the theory of satkhyāti on metaphysical and psychological grounds. According ing to the Vedanta doctrine of pañcīkarana, each of the five elements constituting the universe is a com- pound of an eighth part of each of the other four pure elements and half of its own pure form. In the case of the mirage, though a desert contains all the five bhūtas in varying proportions, only water, which is very insignificant, is apprehended. In nacre-silver illusion, consciousness reveals only the silver element- due to memory, similarity and other causes-which is the insignificant portion of nacre. In the case of other illusions also there is revelation of reality, how- 

अतः सर्व विज्ञानजातं यथार्थमिति सिद्धम् (श्रीभाष्यम्, 1.1.1.). 

xvi 

ever trifling it may be. Even the partial identity of an object is accepted as real, since it reveals some aspect of reality though not the whole of it. The difference between prama and bhrama is this: while pramā satisfies the needs of practical experience as it reveals the reality of objects, bhrama does not. Though meta- physically one can justify even the existence of water element in desert, the mirage is admitted to be an illusion from a practical standpoint, as water content of the desert is too little for practical purpose. 

The point to be considered is not to examine the scientific exactitude of the theory of visual perception propounded by past thinkers in justification of sat- khyāti. It is useful to find out the underlying principle of satkhyāti. The main function of consciousness is to reveal the reality of an object. Consciousness in its perfect expanded state reveals reality without any blemish. But in samsara, consciousness reveals partial visions, and incomplete knowledge of things result due to its limiting contraction. 12 

[Inference proceeds from the knowledge of vyapti (pervasion) between vyapya (pervaded) and vyāpaka (pervader). In a case where fire pervades smoke, fire is called vyāpaka and smoke vyapya. When there is cognition that smoke is pervaded by fire (i.e., the vyāpaka is more extensive than the vyapya) the know- ledge of vyapaka, namely, fire is obtained as in the inference, 'Wherever there is smoke, there is fire'. To ascertain the relation of vyāpti between two phenomena a single observation is not sufficient. Therefore Visis- ṭādvaita emphasizes the need for repeated observation to establish the universal pervasion beyond doubt. The 

some cases 

xvii 

syllogism is not restricted to five members only. In 

aseand 

three-membered syllogism serves the purpose, and in other cases even two-membered syllogism is recognized as sufficient. Upamana (compa- rison) and arthāpatti (postulation) are brought under anumana, since they depend upon the knowledge of vyapti. 

Sabda (verbal or scriptural testimony) is recogni- zed as a special source of knowledge. Scriptural testimony alone can claim the position of the authoritative means of knowledge with regard to Brahman, which never falls within the range of pratyakṣa or anumana. A statement is authoritative when it is uttered by a trustworthy person, when it is free from errors due to defects of sense organs, or when its meaning is not contradicted by any other cognition. The Vedas are authoritative in toto. The two sections of the Vedas, namely karmakāṇda and jñanakanda, do not contradict each other. The earlier section or the karmakända treats of the various modes of upasana (worship) and the latter section is devoted to Brahman, the object of worship. Hence both the kändas of the Vedas constitute one homogeneous subject. Unlike the Mīmāmsă school where validity of verbal statement is restricted to those vedic texts which have for their scope what is yet to be accomplished (sadhya), in Visiṣṭādvaita the vedic texts which denote Brahman an existent reality (siddha), are also equally authoritative. The Pañca- räträgama and the Vaikhānasāgama, which do not contradict the Vedas, are authoritative in toto ac- cording to this system.iw- tuo Hor

2. 

The object of valid knowledge (prameya) is divid- ed into two main categories as dravya (substance) and adravya (non-substance). Dravya is not only the material cause but as the locus of change. There are six dravyas-prakṛti, kāla, dharmabhūta- jñāna, nityavibhuti, jīva and Iśvara. Adravya, which is an attribute, is always dependent on dravya. While dravya as an attribute is subject to change, the dravya, as the substantive element, does not undergo any change. A characteristic feature of Visiṣṭādvaita is that adravya is sometimes viewed as both substance and attribute. For instance, though prabha (light) is an attribute of an effulgent object, it serves also as a sub- stance, since it is subject to contraction and diffusion, and possesses colour as an attribute. From the absolute standpoint Isvara is the only dravya, and the world of matter and selfs are his attributes. Iśvara and jīva viewed as substantive elements are not subject to modi- fications, while prakṛti, kāla, dharmabhūtajñāna and nityavibhuti as attributive elements undergo change. 

The s 

The adravyas are ten. Sattva, rajas and tamas are the qualities of prakṛti. Sound, touch, colour, taste and smell are the qualities of the five bhūtas 

.and like ākāśa etc. Samyoga (conjunction) is the external relation between substances. Sakti (potency) is the effecting agent of causation in all causal substances. 

PRAKRTI 

Prakrti, characterized by the three gunas, consti- tutes the stuff out of which the universe evolves. It is 

xix 

the abode of individual self in mundane existence. It is called mulaprakṛti, since it is the primordial cause of the cosmos. It is known as ākāśa, as it is eternal in spite of its manifold changes and modifications. It is termed as avyakta, as it is very subtle in its causal state. It is called avidya, as it is opposed to the know- ledge of Reality, and is known as māyā, as it is the cause of cosmic wonders.zul) had 

ao When the matter is in an extremely latent state without distinction of name and form, it is known as pralaya. From prakṛti, known as tamas in the begin- ning of evolution, mahat appears with the three states into ahankara of sattva, rajas and tamas. Mahat evolves into ahankära with the same three states called sättvikahankära (vaikarika), rājasahankara (taijasa) and tāmasahankära (bhūtādi). From sättvikāhankāra, aided by the rajasā- haǹkāra, proceed the eleven senses (five karmendriyas, five jñānendriyas and manas). From tāmasahaṁkāra, aided by taijasa, arise the five gross elements of ākāśa etc., through the media of the five tanmatras of sound, touch, colour, savour and odour. 

The entire process of cosmic evolution is nothing but change of states. The distinction between cause and effect is not real. A particular anterior state is called cause and a particular posterior state is called effect. Every effect connotes a pre-existing cause. The doctrine of satkāryavāda or pariņāmavāda affirms the non-difference of cause and effect. 

KALA 

Kāla (time) is eternal and all-pervasive. Unlike prakṛti, it is devoid of the three gunas of sattva, rajas 

XX 

and tamas. Time as effect, which we experience in our ordinary life, is changing and non-eternal. Months and years according to human and divine standards, the four yugas, the birth of Manus, etc., and nitya, naimittika and prākṛta dissolutions are dependent on time. It serves as an instrument in the cosmic func- tions of Isvara. Though time has independence in the lilāvibhuti (play-manifestation), it has no indepen- dent status in the nityavibhuti (eternal-manifestation). 

NITYAVIBHŪTI 

weddings 

Nityavibhuti is the immaterial, infinite domain beyond prakṛti and its three gunas. It is self-luminous and is charaterized by what is known as śuddhasattva, different from the sattva of the three guņas: It is known by the different names of paramapada, tripadvi- bhūti, ānandaloka, etc. Vaikuntha, the city of God, is situated within the realm of nityavibhuti. It is the stuff out of which the bodies of Isvara, the eternals, and the liberated selfs are made. It is the means for the enjoy- ment of the liberated self. The five śaktis of sarva, nivṛtti, viśva, puruşa and parameṣṭhin, and the six attributes of jñāna, śakti, bala, aiśvarya, vīrya and tejas manifest in this eternal domian of suddhasattva. Though it is beyond prakṛti, it is capable of descending and permeating the consecrated images (arca) in sacred places. 

DHARMABHŪTAJÑĀNA 

14 

The conception of dharmabhūtajñāna has already been indicated in dealing with the psychology of per- ception. It is eternal and all-pervasive in respect ofxxix 

Iśvara and jīvas. It is not only self-illumined but is also of the nature of both dravya and guna (substance and attribute). Dravya is that which is the substratum of states, and guna depends upon dravya. Dharma- bhūtajñāna is conceived as a dravya, since it is the substratum of change through its states of expansion and contraction; and as a guna, since it inheres in a substance like jīva or Isvara. 

JAYRA 

dan Terms such as mati, prajñā, samvit, śemuși, etc. are synonyms of dharmabhūtajñāna. All mental states are reduced to consciousness, inasmuch as jñāna is the attribute as well as the essence of individual self. There is no feeling that is not more or less mixed by thinking, no volition that is not influenced by thought. The consciousness is, as it were, an ocean which has the multifarious ripples of mental life. Hence pratyakṣa, anumana, sabda, instincts, desires and passions are but the various phases of dharmabhūtajñāna. It embraces the paths of karma, jñāna and bhakti, and constitutes the root of religious experience. Finally, when the religious experience develops into firm meditation which is compared to the uninterrupted flow of oil, it becomes the means for realizing the beatific form of the Divine. Thus the religious consummation is absolutely depen- dent on the perfect manifestation of dharmabhūta- jñāna. 

[The spiritual discipline in the path to perfection. begins with karmayoga which is action without any regard for the fruits, illumined by the true knowledge of the individual self and the Highest. The discipline of karmayoga destroys the impurities of the mind, generates jñāna, and through it, or directly, prepares 

xxii 

the mind for bhakti. Jñanayoga is meditation upon the individual self, as distinct from prakṛti and its effects, after realizing its true nature from the instruc- tions of the preceptor. Bhaktiyoga is a continuous stream of remembrance of Iśvara, uninterrupted like the continual flow of oil poured from one vessel to another, and is characterized by the eightfold limbs of yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samadhi. Such steady remembrance which is of the same character as intuition results only from the sevenfold discipline (sadhanasaptaka) of viveka (discrimination), vimoka (mental detachment), abhyasa (constant practice), kriya (good actions), kalyāna (virtu- ous conduct), anavasada (cheerfulness), and anuddarṣa (non-exultation). 

Bhaktiyoga is the classical pathway to liberation.] [But there is an alternative path to release for those who find it difficult to practise the austere disciplines of sadhanasaptaka and aṣṭāngayoga, and who are not qualified to receive instruction in the Veda and the Upanisads. This may be followed by anyone, irres- pective of his or her limitations, physical, mental, or social. This is known as prapatti. The heart of pra- patti is absolute self-surrender with the firm faith in the saving grace of Isvara. The main characteristics of prapatti are 'to conceive what is in conformity with the will of God, to reject what is disagreeable to Him, to have firm faith that He will save, to seek Him alone as the protector and to surrender one's self to him in all meekness'. A single act of self-surrender in all sincerity is sufficient to bring about release at once. J

JIVA 1 

Like Iśvara, the jīva is of the nature of conscious- ness and possesses dharmabhūtajñāna as an inseparable attribute. It is real, eternal and unborn. It is distinct from the body, the sense organs, mind and vital airs. Though the individual self, as a mode of Brahman, is essentially of the same nature, it is actually distinct; for it is of monadic size and resides in a separate body. It is the agent, the enjoyer, the embodied Self and the body. It is the embodied Self with regard to its physical body. It is the body with regard to Isvara. It is not only sentient, but it is also of the essence of ananda. Samsara is due to avidya which is of the nature of karma, accumulated by the jīva in its previous births. In this condition jñāna and ananda are obscured but fully manifest in the state of liberation. In spite of its monadic size, the jīva can contact the ends of space through its attributive knowledge. 

The jivas, which are innumerable, belong to three classes. The nityas (eternals) are those who have never been caught in saṁsāra, and who have from eternity been enjoying ananda in the Supreme Abode. The muktas (liberated) are those souls who have attained liberation through bhakti and prapatti. The baddhas (the bound) are those who are not liberated from the transmigratory existence due to avidya and karma. At the moment of giving up the body, the jiva which has attained to the knowledge of Brahman issues out of the body through the aperture in the crown of the head and moves upwards through the rays of the sun. The released self ultimately reaches its supreme goal and 

xxiv 

enjoys ananda for ever being established in the com- munion with God. Mokṣa is essentially of the nature of sǎyujya (communion), and not sälokya (co-existence), sarūpya (similarity) or samipya (intimacy).

ISVARA

10, 

The relation of Isvara to cit and acit has already been mentioned. He is the controller (niyanta), the principal (śeşin) of all, the worshipped in every act, the bestower of all fruit, the sustainer of all and the supreme cause of all effects, while cit and acit are his modes and subsidiaries (sesas), the controlled and the supported. Since consciousness presupposes a consci- ous self, the Reality is not identical with consciousness. Hence Iśvara is not, pure non-differenced Being, nor pure Consciousness, but the highest Self, characterized essentially by consciousness and unsurpassable ānanda. He is the sole cause of the universe since he compre- hends it within himself in latent form prior to creation, and then 

then by his will manifests what is latent. 

The conception of God as the Supreme Person and creator raises the following question: How can the Supreme Being be eternally perfect, if he manifests himself as the world? Will not the imperfections of the world adhere to the perfect Being also? Visiṣṭādvaita attempts to solve this problem by its doctrine of sarira- śarīrī-sambandha or the relation between the world and Brahman as body and soul. Brahman has the world of life and matter for his body, and constitutes the Universal Self of that body. The world-body has two states, kāraṇa and karya, or the causal and the 

XXV 

effected, the nature of which are contraction and expansion. These states belong to the world-body of Brahman alone and not Brahman himself. Expan- 

sion is evolution and contraction is involution. Brahman becomes or manifests the world in the sense that he evolves the body which is his attribute. Not that the essence of Reality is in a state of flux. The notion of a Supreme Person, whose attribute only is in a state of manifestation, makes the divine Being, the substantive element, the ground of all existence. (The entire process of evolution in the form in which Iśvara mani- fests himself in and through the world-body is an opportunity given to jīvas to attain a life of perfec- tion and communion with the Supreme.) Though this view of evolution attributes to the divine Being a transcendent activity, he as the Antaryamin, reveals his nature in the entire process of evolution and human history. This imparts a unique value to the religious experience of all individuals in their intellectual, moral and psychic levels. 

The imperfections clinging to the body do not affect the Universal Self, and the transcendental attributes of the Universal Self do not pervade the body. It is just like infancy, youth, old age and other bodily modifications, which are not the attributes of jīvas, but belong to the body, while pleasure, pain, etc., belong only to the knowing self and not to the body. Thus the relation of sarira-saririn absolves the Reality from having even a shadow of evil.) 

Though Visiṣṭādvaita conceives the Reality as qualified by the realms of cit and acit, these modes do not constitute the whole of Reality; for the realms 

xxvi 

of cit and acit, which as existents are real, are not identified with Iśvara who is a self-conscious Being and the substratum of everything. The view of Reality as adhāra and niyantă not only gives a glimpse of the nature of the Supreme Being, but also suggests the personal nature of the Divine. The Visiṣṭādvaita conception of Deity must be sharply distinguished from pantheism on the one hand, and anthropo- morphism on the other hand. There is no room for pantheism since the Reality, in spite of being the Antaryamin in all, is looked upon as Nārāyaṇa, con- crete and endowed with consciousness and super- individuality. Likewise any sort of anthropomorphism is out of place, since the (Supreme Being is thought of as possessing the six attributes of jñāna, aiśvarya, śakti, bala, vīrya and tejas, besides the infinite auspicious qualities of love, mercy, kindness, etc., which transcend the ordinary qualities of human personality.) 

Though very often the view has been expressed that Hinduism possesses no elements of theism, Visiṣṭādvaita offers a theistic ideal which affirms the existence of the Supreme Person and consistently in- terprets our experience as a whole so as to account for the oneness of the world. Isvara is an actually exis- tent reality who embraces and comprehends all indivi- dual self and the world of matter-not as isolated entities-but as intimately related to one another in an organic manner, and thus forming a perfect and coherent unity. They have no existence apart from him; in and through him life and matter have meaning and significance.

THE AUTHOR AND HIS WORK 

This compendium, entitled Yatindramatadipikā, is one of the most favourite works among the students of Visistadvaita. If the writings of Śrī Vedanta- deśika, the great exponent of Visiṣṭadvaita, are grand and imposing in diction and presentation, this little work is simple, lucid and full of meaning. As a com- pendious presentation of the epistemology, psychology and cosmology of Visiṣṭādvaita, this manual may be said to have no parallel among the works of its class in the system. 

Śrīnivāsa, the author of this standard manual, seems to have been a resident of holy Tirupati, now a township in the Chittoor district of the Presidency of Madras. It is clear from the colophon of the work that he was a son of one Svämi-puskariņi Govindācārya, a devotee of Sri Venkṭeśa, and a disciple of Mahācārya of Vadhula-gotra. This Māhācārya or. Mahārāya is identified with Doḍḍayyācārya of the Kandala Vadhūla- gotra.2 Mähācārya ranks with the great exponents of the Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy. He wrote a famous com- mentary named Candāmāruta on Vedäntadesika's Satadusani which exhibits his genius and originality as a thinker. Apart from Candamaruta, he has to his credit more than seven works, most of which have not yet been printed. Some of these are Advaitavidyāvi- jaya, Brahmasutrabhāṣya-upanyasa, Parikaravijaya, 1 इति श्रीमद्वाधूलकुलतिलक श्रीमन्महाचार्यस्य प्रथमदासेन श्रीमद्वेङ्कटगिरिनाथ- पदकमलसेवापरायणस्वामिपुष्करिणीगोविन्दाचार्यसूनुना श्रीनिवासदासेन विरचिता यतीन्द्रमतदीपिकाख्या शारीरकपरिभाषा समाप्ता ।

Pārāśaryavijaya, Brahmavidyāvijaya, 

Vedantavijaya, and Sadvidyavijaya. According to Govindācārya Svāmin, Mahācārya was a friend and contemporary of Appayyadikṣita, one of the greatest scholars of his time. 

Mr M. T. Narasimha Iyengar thinks that he had a controversy with Dīkṣita or the philological significance of the word Nārāyaṇa.1 Dīkṣita is gene- rally placed between 1420-1593 A.D. So Mahācārya might have lived towards the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth century. 

rāja 

In this connection it is worth noting that Dharma- rāja Adhavarin, the celebrated author of the Vedanta- paribhāṣā, also lived in the seventeenth century. It appears that Srinivasa was aware of his senior con- temporary's work as he in some places quotes the very st words of Dharmaraja while presenting the prima facie ve 

-linst view of Advaita.2 While Dharmaraja calls his work Vedāntaparibhāṣā, Śrīnivāsa names his Šarīrakapari- 

bhāṣā. 

tang d 

Srinivasa was a direct descendant in the long line of Śrīvaiṣṇava apostles. His immediate preceptor Mahācārya and other Mahācāryas of the same line who were domiciled in Colasimhapuram trace their ancestry to Dasarathi, a nephew of Śrī Rāmānuja.3 So our author had the benefit of the traditional teachings, so valued in the guruparampara of Śrīvaiṣṇavas. Śrīnivasa has no pretensions to origniality, since he, at

the beginning of his work, acknowledges his indebted- ness to the former acaryas beginning from Bhagavan Bodhayana to his immediate guru, Mahācārya. In the epilogue also he gives a long list of ancient works from which he has drawn upon. The list starts with the Dramiḍabhasya and ends with Parasaryavijaya, the work of Mahācārya. This suggests that the famous Dramiḍabhāṣya was available as late as the seventeenth 

century.

## Intro

Sri Ramanuja's Visishtadvaita is noted for the following features: (a) it propounds a credible doctrine of complete identity between God and the Absolute; (b) it harmonises God's transcendence (paratva) with His accessibility (soulabhya); and (c) it inculcates the highest type of devotion without belittling the part of intellectualism and social duties in spiritual life.



While the doctrine first gained articulation as a system of thought in the now unavailable writings of Dramidacharya and later in those of the illustrious Yamunacharya, it was Sri Ramanuja (1017--1137) who put these devotional traditions coming from the Alwars down, into the mould of the Upanishadic thought by embodying them in the form of commen- taries based on the Vedantic scriptures.



Since then, several pious and scholarly savants wrote on the doctrines of the system, the most brilliant of them being Sudarsana Suri and Vedanta Desika. There were also several others of lesser calibre and originality but nonetheless noted for their lucid exposition of the system. Among these was the author of the present text Srinivasadasa, disciple of Mahacharya who lived in the later half of the 16th century.



His work, the Yatindramatadipika, is a brief but comprehensive writing on the system, dealing as it does with its epistemology, ontology, psychology, cosmology and theology. As a complete handbook in simple and lucid language, it is one of the best for the study of Visishtadvaita.

1. Srinivasa, the presiding deity of Tirupati (Chittoor Dis- trict, Madras Presidency).

2. A hillock on which the shrine of Sri Devaraja is situated in modern Kañcipuram.

3. Modern Sholinghur (North Arcot District, Madras Presidency).

   4 & 6. Srl Rāmānujācārya.

5. It is quite probable that Krsna is identical with Sri Yamuna- cārya, the grand spiritual preceptor of Śrī Rāmānuja.

7. Śri Venkaṭanatha (or Vedantadesika), a great philosopher, poet, leader and expounder of Visiṣṭadvaita who was born in 1269 A.D. at Tuppil near Kañcipuram.

8. Sri Mahācārya alias Dodḍayyacarya, the preceptor of Srinivasa, the author of the present book.

9. Śri is Lakṣmi. Śri and Nārāyaṇa are inseparably united; this dual form of the Godhead constitutes the highest Brahman, the Father-Mother principle of the universe. The mutual relation of Srt and Nārāyaua, in the language of the Pañcaratras, is one of avinābhava like that of dharma and dharmin, ahanta and aham, light and luminosity, sun and sunshine, etc. Though they are regarded as distinct, there is no difference in their functions or tastes. The so-called dualism is kept up for cosmic functions and redemption of the jivas. As Srivatsankamiśra puts it in his Sristava even Bhagavan is guided by Sri in His cosmic functions as well as redemptive acts. If Nārāyaṇa represents the principle of justice, as the Father of the universe, Laksmi, as the Mother of all, is the embodiment of days or kṛpa. She mediates on behalf of the bound jiva and bestows upon him salvation.

10. According to Visiṣṭadvaita liberation is not identity with Brahman. When the mukta gives up his physical body, he reaches Vaikuntha, the spiritual realm made of bliss itself. In this noumenal

18. Śrī Rāmānuja.

19. The preceptor of Srinivasa.

20. One of the most important doctrines of Visiṣṭādvaita is that Brahman is the saririn while cit and acit form the sarira. And for this reason Vedanta is known as Sarirakaśāstra. This manual which discourses in technical phraseology on the inner relation betweer. Brahman and the world of cit and acit is called Sārīra- kaparibhāṣā or the philosophy of pan-organismalmonism.

21. Literally it means 'The Light of the System of Yatipati or Rāmānuja'.

22. The Carvākas accept only one pramaṇa, viz., perception: the Bauddhas and Vaiseṣikas accept two pramaņas, viz., percep- tion and inference: the Sankhyas accept three, viz., perception, inference and verbal testimony: the Naiyayikas accept four, viz., perception, inference, comparison and verbal testimony: the Prabhakaras accept five, viz., perception, inference, comparison, verbal testimony and postulation: the Bhaṭṭas and the Advaitins accept six, viz., the five above pramāņas and non-cognition: the Paurānikas accept eight pramaņas, viz., the above six pramāņas and sambhava and aitthya: the Visiṣṭadvaitins like the Sankhyas accept only three pramaņas, viz., perception, inference and verbal testimony. Later on it will be shown under appropriate heads why srmit, pratyabhijña, anupalabdhi, üha and samsaya are brought under pratyakṣa, and upamana and arthapatti under anumana.NOTES AND REFERENCES

23. According to Vedanta cosmology, the acit differentiates itself into the successive forms of the twenty-four categories of prakṛti, mahat, ahankara, the eleven indriyas, the five tanmatras and the five bhūtas.

31. It is difficult to bring out the full import of the word *vyavahara'. It is not mere conduct or behaviour. Vyavahāra stands for the test of practical needs of life in their proper perspec- tive. Prof. M. Hiriyanna has translated vyavahārānuguna as *adapted to practical interests of life'. Knowledge is true not only when it agrees with outside reality, but also when it satisfies the practical interests of life. Truth is that which is both experienti- ally and experimentally verified.

32. To cognize a nacre as a piece of silver.

33. E.g., the definition 'that is a cow which possesses horns' applies to buffaloes also which are not intended to be defined.

34. Previously it was stated that instrument (karana) of valid knowledge is pramaņa. Here the meaning of karana is explained.

35. A section of the Advaitins themselves do not accept the view of valid knowledge as consisting in having for its content a thing that is not already known (anadhigata).

36. If wrong knowledge is generated owing to defective sense organ, it cannot be defined as 'that knowledge which is adapted to practical interests of life as they really are'. And consequently owing to the absence of proper instrument of prama, the evidence becomes invalid.

37. What was indefinite and devoid of specific judgement in the nirvikalpaka perception becomes definite and determinate in the savikalpaka perception. In Advaita epistemology the savi- kalpaka apprehends relatedness whereas the nirvikalpaka does not

    162

    YATINDRAMATADIPIKĀ

    apprehend any relation (samsarga). If the latter is absolutely non- relational there arises some difficulty in determining its percepti- bility. Hence in Visiṣṭadvaita the nirvikalpaka is called 'prathama- pindagrahana' or the cognition of the individual for the first time in which the generic character of the object alone is apprehended. The second is called 'dvitiyapindagrahana' or the cognition of the individual for the second time in which what was already known becomes explicit. It may be noted that both perceptions are saviseṣa not nirviseṣa.

    PATOME

38. A substance comes into contact with visual sense along with its colour which is connected with the jar through the relation of asrayana'. This sense-relation which causes perceptual know- ledge is known in Visiṣṭadvaita as 'samyuktasrayanasambandha'.

39. According to Naiyayikas 'samavaya' or inherence is one of the causes that brings about perceptive cognition.

40. Here Visiṣṭadvaita follows the Nyaya theory of smrti. According to Annambhaṭṭa, smrti is the knowledge which is caused only by the samskära. A samskara is nothing but a reminiscent impression derived from a prior experience. When such an 'impres- sion' dependent on a prior experience becomes the cause of memory, it cannot claim to be a separate way of knowing.

41. The famous shrine of Sri Ranganatha is situated in Srirangam.

42. According to Bhaṭṭas and Advaitins, pratyabhijñā is a cognitive complex consisting of pratyakṣa and smrti. But the Naiyayikas would account for it by including in pratyakṣa of a parti- cular type without recognizing any such parts. The Visiṣṭadvaitin, to keep up consistency, would have to bring pratyabhijñā under pratyakṣa, as smrti itself is included in pratyakṣa. For pratyabhijñā is nothing but perceptual experience arising through the contact of the sense organ with some object.

43. 43. This is a vexed question among the different schools of Indian philosophy. The Advaitins along with the Bhaṭṭas accept abhava as the sixth pramaņa. The Naiyayikas do not admit it as a distinct pramana, though they hold it as a distinct category. The Visiṣṭadvaitins along with the Prabhakaras refute the theory that abhava is a distinct category, and equate it with the 'mere floor' (or kevaladhikarana) in the absence of a jar on the floor.

44. Cf. Sribhāṣya (I, i, 1): "Those who understand the Veda hold that all cognition has for its object what is real; for śruti and smrti alike teach that everything participates in the nature of everything else'. In the scriptural account of evolution it is said that each of these elements was made tripartite. For instance, the red colour in fire comes from the primal fire, white colour from water and the black colour from earth. In the same way all things are composed of elements of all things. The Vedanta theory of pañcikarana says that all things are composed of all the five ele- ments in varying degrees. But the thinghood of every object is largely shaped by the preponderant element. We find some simi- larity between nacre and silver owing to intermixture of common component parts. In the nacre-silver illusion, owing to ocular defect, the percipient picks up a nacre mistaking it for silver though the silver-content is insignificant. When the percipient's vision is free from any defect, he apprehends the nacre-content, and there is no illusion for him. Hence the cognition of silver in nacre is true though the silver-content has no economic value. Likewise when one cognition is being sublated by another, the disillusion- ment is explained on the basis of preponderant element in its constitution. So whenever we apprehend the preponderant element of an object, the cognition becomes more true, the fragmentary perception becomes less true. There is no illusion in the Visiṣṭā- dvaita epistemology in its literal sense.

45. There are five theories of illusion: atmakhyāti, asatkhyāti, akhyāti, anyathākhyāti and anirvacaniyakhyāti. These theories of bhrama are accepted by Yogacaras, Madhyamikas, Prabhakaras, Naiyayikas and Advaitins respectively.

    The Vijñānavada school of Buddhism, otherwise known as the Yogacara school, explains bhrama as subsisting in the 'atman' (consciousness) which externalizes itself in the form of objects like silver in the silver-nacre illusion. This theory of error is called atmakhyāti. Visistadvaita refutes the theory of atmakhyāti in which, cognition arising without a corresponding object produces silver and makes it its object; for this khyāti fails to explain not only the production of the effect, but also contradicts an admitted principle according to which there are four causes that bring out a cognition: they are the adhipati-cause, the sahakari-cause, the

    164

    YATINDRAMATADĪPIKĀ

    alambana-cause, and the samanantara-cause. According to Yoga- caras, cognitions perish absolutely, and do not possess any perma- nency. On the basis of this principle it is difficult to prove that the form of subsequent cognition is due to the action of the previous cognition independent of external object. For, it cannot be main- tained how in the midst of a series of cognitions of red colour, there arises immediately the cognition of another colour. There- fore the conclusion is that the manifoldness of cognitions is due only to the manifoldness of objects.

    The Sunyavādins explain bhrama as consisting in the cognition of asat (non-being). In the case of a wrong cognition 'this is silver", which arises in the absence of silver, the object of cognition is 'asat'. On the basis of such experience, even asat becomes compe- tent as an object of cognition. This theory of error is known as asatkhyāti.

    Visiṣṭadvaita strongly repudiates the theory of the Madhya- mikas who state that there is nothing save a universal void. If it is stated that 'Nothing is the only Reality', the Vedantasūtrà replies, 'And on account of its being unproved in everyway' (II, ii, 30). If these nihilists are asked whether they hold that everything is existence, or non-existence, or anything else, they cannot establish nothingness on any of these views; for, the ideas of existence and non-existence have reference only to particular states of really existing things. Hence any theory of nothingness would imply the acceptance of the reality of things. Moreover, if one wants to establish the doctrine of sunya, he must attempt it only with the help of some means of knowledge, the reality of which he must admit. On the contrary, if he does not acknowledge the validity of the means of knowledge, everything becomes real. The con- clusion is that asat cannot be established in any way.

    The Prabhakaras accept the reality of two cognitions, the per- ceived nacre as 'this' (idam) and the recollection of silver seen elsewhere. At the time of cognition, the percipient is unable to identify the recollection of silver as recollection since he merely apprehends it as cognition. The object of recollection, silver, enters into his consciousness, divested of its association with a particular place or time. In other words, when two cognitions of silver and nacre arise, the percipient misses their difference

    NOTES AND REFERENCES

    165

    owing to his non-discrimination consequent on the visual defect. So there arises pravṛtti (volition) on his part to pick up the so-called silver. When he finds that there is no silver at all, the disillusion- ment comes with the conviction that his activity was in vain. Even this theory is imperfect as it cannot adequately account for the mental decision on the part of the percipient to pick up silver when there is no silver at all. Nor is mere non-discrimination between the recollection of silver and the present perception sufficient to induce pravṛtti leading to activity.

    The Nyaya theory of bhrama is known as anyahākhyāti. According to this khyati when one thing, nacre, is wrongly per- ceived as silver the erroneous cognition takes the form 'this is silver'. Here 'this' stands for nacre which is not perceived as nacre owing to some ocular defect. This visual perception of nacre as 'this' arises in the usual way by the contact of the sense with the object. Only the silverness which is the property of some silver existing elsewhere is presented to the perception as belonging to nacre as 'this'. But how could there be a perception of silver when there is no sense-relation between the silver and the sense of sight? So, to get over this difficulty the Naiyayikas hold that the real silver is connected with the sense of sight through a super-normal type of sense-relation (alaukika-sannikarsa). Though the Naiyayika contends that sat alone is being presented to the consciousness, he confounds the theory by trying to bring an absent reality within the range of the sense through supernormal relation; otherwise he cannot explain how bhrama consists in wrongly perceiving the nacre as silver which is elsewhere.

    The Advaita theory of anirvacaniyakhyāti holds that bhrama is neither real nor unreal, nor both, and is therefore inexplicable. According to Advaita (vide Vedantaparibhāṣā) the silver-nacre illusion takes place in the following manner: When the defective sight of a person comes in contact with an object (nacre), a vṛtti of the internal-organ which has the form of 'this' and the form of brightness arises; and in that vṛtti, Caitanya limited by 'this' is reflected. Then owing to out-going vrtti, the Caitanya limited by 'this', the Caitanya limited by the vṛtti and cognizer-consciousness become one. Then avidya, which is present in vişayacaitanya identical with pramatṛcaitanya, which has nacreness for its mode,

    YATINDRAMATADĪPIKĀ

    and helped by the samskara of silver, kindled up by the similarity between the object seen as 'this' and silver, transforms itself into an object with the appearance of silver and into an apparent cogni- tion of silver. In this state of false superimposition the experience is real as long as the cognition lasts, and then becomes unreal when true knowledge dawns.

    Of all the theories of bhrama, none has been subjected by Sri Ramanuja to such a thorough examination as the theory of avidya. This classical refutation is known as 'saptavidha-anupa- patti', viz., asrayanupatti, tirodhananupapatti, svarupānupapatti, anirvacaniyatvanupapatti, pramānānupapatti, nivartakanupapatti and nivṛttyanupapatti. In explaining the anirvacaniyatvanupapatti, it is asked: what is meant by the anirvacaniyata of avidya. If anirvacaniyatva is defined as the difference of avidya from sat and asat, it would be actually inexplicable, since no means of knowledge can enable us to understand it. In our experience we find that the whole host of objects is arranged according to our states of consciousness (pratiti), and each state of consciousness presents itself in the form of sat or asat. If, therefore, we have to assume that of states of consciousness, which are in the form of sat or asat, the object is neither sat nor asat, then anything might be the object of any state of consciousness.

53. Water always exists in conjunction with light and earth; but owing to the ocular defect of the percipient and the adṛṣṭa, the light and earth are not cognized, while the water is alone cognized.

54. As a matter of fact, the direction is one. By a sort of artificial division, the direction is divided into east, west, south, north, etc. A village which is to the east of one is to the west of another.

55. According to the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika realists, dik is a distinct substance. Later on it will be stated in the fourth avatara that dik need not be admitted as a distinct category inasmuch as it is derivable from the connection of the apparent motion of the sun with the sky.

56. This is analogous to the cognition of a real wheel; but in the case of a real wheel no intervals are cognized as there are none, while in the case of a firebrand none are cognized owing to the rapidity of the movement.

58. One samagri cognizes the moon in her real place. The other samagri moving somewhat obliquely cognizes at first a spot near the moon, and then the moon herself who appears a little removed from her original position. Although there is only one moon qualified by connection with two spots simultaneously, the affection of the eye gives rise to difference in the samagri, which in turn to a double apprehension, and the latter again to the double- ness of the moon.

59. It is not possible to apprehend any object devoid of all difference; for instance, a cow devoid of attributes and configura- tion. It has been already stated that even the non-determinate perception apprehends only objects marked with difference.

60.

All states of consciousness have for their object some- thing that is qualified by difference as appears in the case of judge- ment like 'this is a jar'. When a jar is apprehended, it is so appre- hended as different from all other objects such as book, table, etc. Difference there means nothing but jarness. But in the perception 'this is a jar', it is comprehended not as difference but as jarness alone. When it is to be comprehended as difference, it requires a counter-entity; and so comprehended it is responsible for the saying 'jar is different from cloth'.

168

61. Visiṣṭādvaita does not admit these two faults; for the only objects of perception are those that are qualified by generic character etc., which, as relative things, give rise to the judgement revealing the difference between themselves and the things in which they inhere. Moreover, as soon as a perceptive cognition takes place, we at once apprehend on the one hand, the generic character which is the basis of difference from everything else, and on the other, the essential nature of the thing itself. Just as con- sciousness manifests itself as well as the object known, the difference also reveals itself as well as the things which differ.

All of them were in a great fix as the tenth person could not be traced. A Nestor came to their rescue and counted them all from one to nine and declared the tenth person as 'thou art the tenth'.

69. Cf. the atomic theory of the Vaiseṣikas refuted in the fourth avatara.

70. If Indra and other gods are corporeal, they must be non- eternal also. Consequently the vedic words denoting the vedic deities also become non-eternal. Secondly, from the Scripture we understand that many mantras have 'makers'; for instance, 'Reverence to the rsis who are the makers of the mantras", "That is Agni; this is a hymn of Visvamitra', etc. From all this it may be assumed that the Vedas have personal origin only. This view is refuted by Visiṣṭadvaita. For, vedic words such as Indra and others, unlike the word Devadatta which denotes a particular individual, denote by their own power particular species of beings. like the word 'cow' which denotes particular species of animals,

    Y 14

    NOTES AND REFERENCES

    169

    Therefore, when an individual belonging to Indra-class has perished, the Creator, on the basis of the vedic word 'Indra' which is being presented to his mind creates another Indra possessing the same attributes. Hence Vedas cannot be non-eternal owing to corpo- reality of the gods.

    Now, as regards the authorship of the Vedas; the creation of Vasistha and other rṣis, who denote classes is preceded by their being presented to Prajapati's mind through those words; then He creates them endowed with the very same characteristics and appoints them to 'see' the very same 'kaņdas' and 'mantras'. These ṛsis, being endowed thus, undergo the proper discipline and finally 'see' the mantras in their very sounds and accents, declared by the Vasisthas and other rṣis of former aeons. The vedic mantras have a personal origin only in such a relative sense.

71. The Infinite Being beyond all contact with the sense is not an object of perception or inference. In the first place, percep- tion being based either on the sense organs or on yogic powers is incapable of apprehending that which transcends all relations. Nor does Brahman fall within the sphere of inference either of the kind which proceeds from the visesa or of the kind based on samanya. The former one is inadmissible, for such inference is not related to anything beyond the range of the senses. Nor is it of the latter kind, since we do not see any linga that is invariably connected with a Supreme Self who is capable of creating the universe. A persistent ratiocination still cannot show us a way to infer the Supreme Self. The teleological and cosmological arguments cannot prove Him as the world-architect or the first cause that exists per se. There is no proof to show that the earth, mountains and oceans though created, were emanated from one Creator. Nor could it be proved that all the effected things have a homogeneous character like a jar, because we see many effects are qualified by the difference of time of production etc. Nor by inference can any one maintain that the highest Self with infinite power alone can create; for even individual beings by means of extraordinary power acquired by religious merit can create. Hence Scripture is the only means for knowing Brahman, the highest Reality.

    ### AVATARA TWO

    ANUMANA

1. What is necessary is that the vyapaka must be more extensive than the vyapya. When one knows that smoke is pervaded by fire, he obtains the knowledge of the vyapaka, namely, fire. For, there may be fire without smoke as in the case of a red-hot iron ball, but where there is smoke, fire is invariably present. Thus when the vyapya is first ascertained, then the knowledge of the vyāpaka is also obtained.

2. It is interesting to note that Srinivasa describes vyapti as an invariable relation not due to connection with any adventitious circumstance, i.e., that it is nirupadhika and not aupadhika. For instance, that smoke is pervaded by fire is an unconditioned relation not brought about by any adventitious circumstance. Per contra, in the proposition, 'Fire is pervaded by smoke', vyapti is not an unconditioned relation, since it depends upon the adventitious contact of wat fuel with fire. Here our author follows the earlier writers on Nyaya who define vyapti as anupadhikaḥ sambandhaḥ. See Primer of Indian Logic, pp. 262-63.

3. Some Naiyayikas criticize the view that the relation of vyāpti is known through repeated observation (bhūyodarśana). According to Dharmaraja, a great thinker of the Advaita school, vyapti is ascertained by the perception of concomitance (sahacara darsana) when there is no cognition of inconstancy. Since what is determinative is sahacaradarsana, it matters little whether the perception is a single one or repeated. This view may be thus examined: All admit that the cognition of vyapti is obtained in experience. A single experience cannot establish the universal pervasion, as one is not sure of the non-existence of the opposite. Granting that a genuine exception stultifies all the previous ex- periences, how is one to know whether the so-called exception isNOTES AND REFERENCES

   171

   genuine or apparent? Hence to make sure that a certain type of relation is actually vyapti, or the contrary experience is a genuine one, one has to eliminate all dubitative conditions by repeated observation. Hence the need for bhūyodarśana.

4. In the proposition, 'The mountain has smoke, because it has fire', contact with wet fuel is the upadhi. The upadhi is perva- sive of the probandum, as contact with wet fuel is found wherever there is smoke. But contact with wet fuel is not found in every place where there is fire: for instance, a red-hot iron ball: hence the upadhi is non-pervasive of the probans.

5.

Pāpārabdha pervades only 'the cause of sorrow' which is the probandum, and not 'service' which is the probans, since every kind of service is not produced by sin.

6. All the three words imply probans, reason or mark.

7. Pakṣadharmată consists in the presence of the invariable concomitant in the subject like a mountain.

8. Dharmin is, that in which certain attributes are conceived as inhering.

9. Pakṣa is that in which the presence of the probandum is doubted, and is yet to be established; as a mountain, when smoke is taken as the probans.

10. Sapakṣa is that in which the probandum is known for certain.

11. Vipakṣa is that in which the absence of the probandum is known for certain.

12. Badhita is that which is advanced to establish a pro- bandum whose absence is proved by another powerful instrument of knowledge. In the syllogism, 'Lake has fire', the probandum 'has fire' is sublated by its opposite 'has no fire' by the existence of water there.

13. In satpratipaksa the probans admits of being neutralized by another counter-probans which may be advanced to prove the non-existence of the probandum. For instance, in the proposition, 'Sound is eternal, because it is audible like sound-ness', the counter- probans is 'karyatva' as in the proposition, 'Sound is non-eternal, because it is an effect like a jar'. In an instance like this two counter- probans neutralize each other and prevent the inference. absence of such counter-probans is asatpratipaksa.

14. The anvayavyatirekin probans has both positive and negative concomitance with the probandum. Vilant

15. The bare anvayin probans has positive concomitance alone. For instance, 'Brahman is expressible by word, because it is a thing like a jar'. Here the negative pervasion is not possible as there is no counter-instance in which the non-existence of the probandum could be known for certain. Moreover, in this syllo- gism, negative pervasion cannot be predicated between word- expressibility and thingness as all things are expressible by words.

16. The kevalavyatirekin probans is that which has negative concomitance alone. For instance, 'Earth is different from the rest, because it possesses smell; whatever is not different from the rest has no smell, as water; this earth is not so; therefore it is not without difference from the rest'. In a proposition like this there is no instance of positive co-presence in the form, 'Whatever has smell is different from the rest', since earth is only the pakṣa which possesses smell.

17. The Naiyayikas recognize three kinds of probans, viz., anvayavyatirekin, kevalanvayin and kevalavyatirekin. According to Advaitins this anumana is of the nature of anvayin alone. They along with the Mimamsakas bring the vyatirekin under a distinct pramana called arthapatti. It is interesting to note that our author recognizes kevalanvayin and anvayavyatirekin and altogether repudiates kevalavyatirekin.

18. It causes one's own anumiti. A person may understand the relation of vyapti between smoke and fire from his repeated observation at kitchen and other places, and make out the generali- zation in the form, 'Wherever there is smoke there is fire'.

19. A person after inferring fire from smoke for himself, uses this syllogism of five members in order to enable another person to have the same inferential cognition.

20. The Advaitins also along with the Mimamsakas maintain that either pratijña, heut and udaharana, or udaharaṇa, upanaya and nigamana are sufficient.

22. Srinivasa along with the Saugatas reduces the syllogism to two propositions viz., udaharaṇa and upanaya. Pervasion between fire and smoke and the presence of probans in the subject are sufficient to make out a valid inference. Since these two essential conditions are established by udaharaṇa and upanaya, the other propositions are considered to be superfluous.

23. Also known as savyabhicara. 24. Also called satpratipaksa.

25. This is the same as the badhita.

26. Here the probans visible' is fallaciously assumed in the subject as visibility cannot be established in respect of jiva. 27. Here the 'sky-lotus' which is the locus of probans being fictitious, the probans 'lotus' has no locus standi.

28. When a person repeatedly observes the pervasion between smoke and fire at kitchen and other places, it acts as a means to arrive at the generalization, 'Wherever there is smoke there is fire'. In the giyen example the perceiver had no occasion to observe that the existents are momentary, and consequently he has not the help of such pramāna to grasp the pervasion.

29. In this syllogism, the prohibition of demeritorious actions is the upadhi. Since prohibition comes into force whenever demeri- torious actions are performed, it is pervasive of the probandum. But there is no prohibition in every place where slaying is done as in the case of immolation involved in kratu. Here the upadhi is non-pervasive of the probans.

30. Here 'producibility' does not establish the eternality of matter, but its contrary, the non-eternality; for whatever is pro- duced is non-eternal.

31. The Naiyayikas recognize a third kind of savyabhicara known as anupasaṁhärin (non-conclusive). Vide TS., the chapter on anumana.

32. In this instance, the reason 'knowability' is equally related to eternal as well as non-eternal things. Since all knowable things are not universally eternal, we cannot predicate eternality to sound, because it is knowable. As Annambhaṭṭa puts it: sadhārana is one which is present in a place where the probandum is absent, as in the syllogism, "The mountain has fire, because it is know- able'. Here knowability is found in a tank where fire is absent.

33. The quality of earth is found in earth only which has smell as its attribute, and not anywhere, either in eternal objects or in non-eternal objects. Since we do not know whether earthness is per- vasive of eternal or non-eternal objects, the reason is doomed to fail. 34. When two opposite reasons counteract each other, they leave us in doubt without establishing any conclusion.

35. Mm. S. Kuppusvami Sastrin has translated 'atidesa- vakya' as assimilative proposition.

36. An animal of the bovine species.

37. Srinivasa refutes the view of upamana as a distinct means of knowledge. He analyses upamana into three discrete parts, each of which is subsumed under pratyakṣa, anumana and sabda. When a person who is ignorant of the meaning of the word 'gavaya' learns from a forester that 'gavaya' resembles cow, it is an example of knowledge derived from the sense of sentences. Secondly, when he goes to a forest and recollects the meaning of atidesavakya on seeing the figure qualified by cow-similarity, it is purely a perceptual cognition, since recollection is derived from samskara which again is caused by a prior experience. And finally, when the knowledge of the figure, qualified by cow-similarity, as 'gavaya' arises in him, it is evidently a cognition based on vyāpti in the form, 'Cow resembles gavaya, because it is the counter- correlate of resemblance existing in a gavaya; when something is the counter-correlate of resemblance existing in another, the former resembles the latter: as the left hand, which is the counter-cor- relate of resemblance existing in the right hand, resembles the right hand'.dw

38. Visiṣṭādvaita along with Nyaya, Sankhya and other schools refuses to recognize arthapatti as a distinct means of know- ledge, since its purpose is served by inference: for instance, in the syllogism, 'Devadatta eats at night, because he is fat without eating by day', 'eating' is the pervasive concomitant of 'fatness', since whenever fatness is seen, there must be eating also. As it is known that Devadatta is not eating by day, the inference is that he must be eating at night.

39. It is of three kinds: vakchala, samanyachala and upacara- chala (NS., I, ii, 52). It is called vakchala when a term is deliberately taken in a wrong sense. For instance, when someone says, 'This

    boy is navakambala' (possessing a new blanket), a quibbler objects, 'He is not navakambala' (possessed of nine blankets). Samanyachala consists in taking the individual for the whole class; for instance, when someone says, "This brahmana is learned', another objects, "This brahmana is not learned, since many brahmanas are not learned'. Upacarachala consists in taking the meaning of an expres- sion literally while it was used metaphorically; for example, when a person says, "The scaffolds cry out', a quibbler objects, 'Scaffolds cannot cry out as they are inanimate objects'. Here the term 'scaf- fold' means the people standing on the scaffolds.

1. The importance of sabda as a distinct pramana cannot be minimized. Since Brahman does not fall within the province of pratyakṣa or anumana, sabda in its aspect of sruti alone can. claim the position of the authoritative means of knowledge with regard to Brahman.

2. Errors arising from the defect of sense organs.

Brahma or Prajapati.

4. This is the position of the purvapakṣin (i.e., the follower of Purvamimamsa): The means of determining the power of words to express things is to watch the speech and actions of people. Speech and action always mean that certain things ought to be performed. No word, therefore, can have for its purpose an accom- plished thing inasmuch as it is the means of knowledge only with reference to things that ought to be performed. Hence vedic texts cannot claim to be a distinct means of knowledge of Brahman, as Brahman is an existing entity and not a thing to be effected. Moreover the Vedas teach that mere works have eternal results. (For instance, akṣayyam ha vai caturmasyayajinaḥ sukrtam bhavati). Hence an inquiry into Brahman is without any purpose when works works alone grant eternal results.

6. Even statements of facts such as 'Your father is doing well', and 'This is not a snake but a rope' evidently have some purpose; namely, such and such terms express such and such meanings. Hence it is baseless to maintain that words have mean- ing only with reference to things that ought to be done.

7. This is how a child learns the connection of words and meanings. The child, while observing that words give rise to ideas in its mind, finds out that the application of a particular word to a particular thing is based upon the expressive power of the word. Thus the theory that words and actions have implication only with reference to the things-that-ought-to-be-done is unjustified.

8. Abhicarakalpa is the name of a treatise on thaumaturgy regarded as a part of the Atharvaveda. If it could be demonstrated that certain mantras have power with reference to the things of the world, it may convince even an unbeliever to have faith in the efficiency of the mantras in relation to the attainment of heaven etc.

9. According to Vṛttikära Bodhayana 'this sariraka is connected with Jaimini's work as contained in sixteen chapters; this establishes that the two Mimämsas constitute one science'. Just as each half of Purvamimämsäsütras consisting of six chapters is separate, and each chapter is separate, the Purva- and Uttara-mimām sās also are separate only in so far as the subject- matter treated in them differs. Hence the whole of the Mimāmsă- sastra beginning with the aphorism 'Now therefore the inquiry into dharma' and ending with the aphorism "There is no return on account of scriptural statement' constitutes one body of doctrine owing to its continuous character of contents and order of succes- sion.

10. Rk is that mantra which is divided into padas each of which consists of a definite number of syllables: for instance, gayatri etc. Yajus is that mantra where there is no division into pādas and which is not set to music. When a mantra is set to music it is called saman. Atharva contains hymns, prayers and invocations either for the safety or destruction of beings.

11. The definition of mantra is a vexed problem in vedic literature. According to Purvamimämsäsütras (II, i, 32), mantras are those texts which express mere assertion. The previous sūtra (II, i, 31) has already declared that the mantras are not injunctive. So Sabarasvamin comments 'that it is only while the sacrifice is being performed that the mantra functions; if it enjoined the act, its functioning would come before the commencement of the per- formance' (Sabarabhāṣya, trs. pp. 200-201). But Laugakṣibhaskara defines that mantras are those which recall to memory objects connected with sacrificial performance (prayogasamavetartha- smarakā mantrāḥ).

12. Arthavada is a declamatory text containing either praise or blame. Though it does not convey any primary meaning of its own, it is connected with some text which is directly injunctive. When a declamatory text is construed with an injunctive text it serves the purpose of eulogising what is enjoined or blaming what is prohibited. For instance, the declamatory text 'Vayu, verily, is the swiftest deity' is connected with the injunctive text 'He who is desirous of prosperity shall sacrifice a white animal to Vayu'. This text recommends the act of sacrifice by praising Vayu. And when a declamatory text says 'He howled', the statement is made with reference to the prohibitory passage 'Silver shall not be given upon the sacrificial grass'. Thus condemnation is expressed of what is prohibited in the injunction. Again, arthavada is of three kinds. The first kind is called gunavada, when there is contradic- tion; as, 'The sun is the sacrificial post'. The second is called anuvada, when repetition is made of an already established thing; as, 'Fire is a remedy against cold'. The last kind is called bhūtārtha- vāda, when it is devoid of contradiction or accomplishment; as, 'Purandara who bears the thunderbolt in his hand'.

13. Apurvavidhi is that injunction which establishes what is not established by any other means of knowledge. In the injunction 'Desiring heaven one should sacrifice', the attainment of heaven is not made known by any other evidence than this injunction. The sacrificer brings into existence a power called apurva which leads the performer to heaven by means of the sacrifice. Similarly water- sprinkling produces in the grain an apurva which is not otherwise possible.xfre

    178

    YATINDRAMATADIPIKA

14. Visistavidhi is but a form of apürvavidhi. The Chan- dogyopanisad (III, 14) states the attributes of Brahman as 'He who consists of mind, whose body is breath, whose form is light' etc. 'Made of mind' means: Brahman can be cognized by a mind purified by meditation through the means of sadhanasaptaka such as viveka, vimoka, etc. alt

15. Parisankhyavidhi is that injunction which excludes one of the two alternatives simultaneously established. In the injunc- tion "This rope (the ancients) took up' etc., there is not the purpose of establishing the seizing of the horse's rope, since that is already established. But it is an injunction of exclusive specification pur- porting to exclude the holding of a donkey's rope.

16. The classical definition of niyamavidhi is thus: 'Restric- tive injunction is one which restricts the course of an action to one particular alternative (instrument) when several alternatives being possible any other of which, without the vidhi, would equally likely be resorted to' (Arthasangraha, translated by D. V. Gokhale, p. 28). According to our author here the injunction restricts the conduct of the student who intends to approach the preceptor for knowledge. The śrutis and smṛtis direct the student to seek the teacher in a particular manner; for instance, Mundakopanisad (I, ii, 12) says, To know that, he, with sacrificial fuel-in hand, must approach a guru who is well versed in the Vedas and absolutely established in the realization of Brahman'.

The Yoga cannot therefore be used for the support of Vedanta.' (S.B.E., Vol. XLVIII, p. 413.)

22. The origin of Sankhya philosophy is attributed to Kapila. 23. Though Kapila is referred to as a model of consummate wisdom, he is not accepted entirely owing to his anti-vedic views such as holding pradhana to be the universal material cause etc., which run counter to the Vedanta doctrine of Brahman being the sole cause of the universe etc. Likewise is Yogakästra first pro- pounded by Hiranyagarbha. Yoga also admits pradhana to be the independent material cause and Iévara as a mere operative cause. Secondly, the Yoga conception of meditation is also of anti-vedic character, since the two objects of meditation, namely the indi- vidual self and Isvara are independent entities, the jiva not having its self in Brahman and Brahman not being the material cause of the world. The conclusion is that such views of Kapila and others which contradict the vedic doctrines of Manusmrti, Bhagavadgītā, Mahabharata and Visnupurana are rejected. But unlike the systems of Jina and Sugata, Yoga and Sankhya are not absolutely rejected, since certain points in all these doctrines are accepted. For instance, the Sankhyan conception of twenty-âve principles and the Yoga method of mental concentration are admitted.

    Since Vedanta texts are concerned with Brahman lying beyond the range of pratyakṣa and other pramāņas, ordinary men with an imperfect knowledge of the Veda can hardly determine the meaning of Vedanta passages without the help of a smrti instituted by a competent and trustworthy person. But, while choosing the help of a smrti one must be very careful as many a smrti contains doctrines opposed to the Veda. Hence one should follow such smrti which does not contradict the Veda.

29. According to the Padmapuräna, the puranas are divided into three kinds. The divison is as follows: Visnu, Naradiya, Bhāgavata, Garuda, Padma and Varaha are called sattvika- puranas; Brahmaṇḍa, Brahmavaivarta, Märkandeya, Bhavisya, Vamana, and Brahma are called rajasa-puranas; while Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Śiva, Skanda and Agni come under the tamasa

    class.

30. A purana treats of five topics as declared in the follow- ing verse:

    Sargasca pratisargaśca vamśo manvantarani ca Vamsanucaritam caiva purāņam pañcalakṣaṇam.

31. The doctrines of Kāpālas, Kalāmukhas, Pasupatas, etc., have to be disregarded owing to their peculiar theory of Reality and strange practices not warranted by the Veda. They maintain the distinction of material and instrumental causes, and hold Pasu- pati to be the instrumental cause of the world. But if Pasupati is regarded as the highest Brahman constituting the Self of all, there will be no difficulty in adopting the essential doctrine of the Pasu- patas.

32. 'Mantra' is found in the place of 'divya' in Sri Vedanta- desika's Pañcarātrarakṣā.

33. The origin of Pañcaratragama is attributed to Śrīman Nārāyana Himself, who, animated by infinite love towards His devotees, taught the science to Narada, Sanḍilya and other great seers through Sanaka and others. According to some critics, the Pañcaratra doctrine is not authoritative since it admits the origi- nation of the jiva, which is opposed to śruti; for instance, from Vasudeva originates the jiva called Sankaraṣaṇa. Śrī Rāmānuja in his commentary on the Vedantasūtras (II, ii, 43) strongly controverts the theory of the origination of the individual self by profusely quoting from the Pañcarātrāgamas. Brahman, known as Vasudeva, abides Himself in a fourfold form (vyuha) with a view to enable His devotees to realize Him in a concrete manner. The identity of the Supreme Brahman with the fourfold form is declared. in the Satvatasamhita: "This is the supreme sastra, the great Brahmopanisad, which imparts true discrimination to BrahmaņasNOTES AND REFERENCES

    worshipping the real Brahman under the name of Vasudeva' (S.B.E., XLVIII, part III, p. 525). The Pauskarasamhita also says, 'That which enjoins that Brahmanas have to worship, under its proper names, the fourfold nature of the Self: that is the authoritative doctrine' (Ibid.). What the agamas emphasize is that the Supreme Self voluntarily assumes the fourfold form of Vasudeva, Sankarṣana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha on account of his love towards devotees. But if it be asked why Sankarṣaṇa and others are identified with jiva etc., it is said in reply that since Sankarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha preside over the jivas, internal organ and ego, they themselves are denoted by those names. As Sri Ramanuja puts it, the case is analogous to that of Brahman who is designated by terms such as ether, breath, etc. According to some, another objection is that Sandilya is supposed to have learnt the doctrine as he did not find any basis in the Veda for the highest realization. This is tantamount to saying that the Pañcarātra system is opposed to the Veda. To this objection Sri Ramanuja replies as follows: 'When the Veda says, "morning after morning those speak untruth who make the agnihotra offering before sunrise", it is understood that the censure there passed on the offering before sunrise is really meant to glorify the offering after sunrise....Analogous to this is the case of Sandilya's alleged objection to the Veda. That the Bhagavata doctrine is meant to facilitate the understanding of the sense of the Veda which by itself is difficult of comprehension, is declared in the Paramasam- hita, "I have read the Vedas at length, together with all the various auxiliary branches of knowledge. But in all these I cannot see a clear indication, raised above all doubt, of the way to blessed- ness, whereby I might reach perfection"; and "The wise Lord Hari, animated by kindness for those devoted to Him, extracted the essential meaning of all the Vedanta texts and condensed it in an easy form" (S.B.E., XLVIII, Part III, p. 527). Thus the Pañca- rātrāgamas are authoritative in toto, since Sriman Nārāyaṇa Him- self taught it with a view to enable His devotees to apprehend the meaning of the Veda.

40. Expectancy (akankṣa), compatibility (yogyata) and proxi- mity (sannidhi) are the necessary factors for arriving at a judgement from a given proposition. Expectancy consists in completing the sense of a judgement by desiring a word. For instance, a single word like 'cow' is incapable of conveying complete sense in the absence of another word. Compatibility consists in the sense being not absurd; for example, 'wet with fire' is sublatable. Proxi- mity consists in the utterance of words without long intervals. If words like 'meditate on God' are uttered with undue delay, there would be absence of proximity which is necessary to convey the verbal cognition.

45. Sound or word proves difference since it possesses the capacity to denote only such things as are affected with difference. Sound has twofold operation, i.e., it operates through words and through sentences. Now, a word is formed from the combination of prakrti (radical element) and pratyaya (suffix). Since prakṛti and pratyaya have different meanings, the word also should neces- sarily convey a meaning affected with difference. And moreover,

47. Before grasping the true knowledge of Vedanta, the import of words would be incomplete since it was thought that the words denote only sentient beings and non-sentient objects. Hence after the dawn of true knowledge, namely, that Reality is the self of cit-acit body, the import of words becomes perfect inasmuch as one knows at this stage that every word denotes nothing except Brahman.

1. Kanāda recognizes (vide Vaiseṣikasūtras, I, i, 4) six padar- thas-substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity and inherence. The Bhaṭṭas admit five padarthas-substance, generality, quality, activity and non-existence; whereas the Prabhakaras recognize eight-substance, quality, activity, generality, inherence, potency, similarity and number. The Sankhyas recognize only prakṛti and purusa; while the Advaitins admit two categories- atman and anatman. Some people think Visiṣṭādvaita admits three categories, namely, cit, acit and Isvara.tal out

2. The Nyaya-Vaiśeşika classification of activity into five kinds seems to be pleonastic, as motion which is caused by con- junction would include all forms of activity.

3. Visistadvaita does not recognize samanya or jāti as a distinct category. For instance, when we perceive a beast, no doubt, the perception takes the form "This is a beast'. But this generic character, uniform as it is to all beasts, is realized in the

   184

   YATINDRAMATADĪPIKĀ

   vyakti itself, and not apart from it. The manifestation of jāti in the vyakti has been possible only owing to the structural simi- larity called samsthana, and this samsthana is nothing but jāti. In this connection it is interesting to know what Sri Rāmānuja says on the subject: (That the generic character of a thing is nothing else but its particular structure follows) from the fact that we do not perceive anything, different from the structure, which could be claimed as constituting the object of the cognition that several individuals possess one and the same general form' (S.B.E., vol. XLVIII, part III, p. 45).

4. Samavaya or inherence is an intimate relation existing between whole and parts, substance and attributes, generic charac- ter and individuals etc. This intimate relation is inseparable as long as the connected substances do not cease to exist. Visiṣṭad- vaita refutes the view that samavaya is a distinct category. Sama- vaya is assumed in order to account for the inseparable and in- dissoluble relation subsisting between two things. Now a reason has to be found out why samavaya is such, and this requires some- thing else to establish it, and so on, ad infinitum. Moreover, it is unreasonable to assume any essential nature for samavaya which itself is an unknown entity.

6. From vaikarika which is of sattva-nature, there arise the indriyas. The bhūtādi which is of tamas-nature produces tanmatras (subtle matter) which in their turn originate gross ele- ments. The taijasa is of the nature of activity, and helps the other two in their functions.

12. Sri Ramanuja's Commentary on the Vedantasutras. There is another reading here, according to which this passage means "The view....should be explained so as not to be in contradiction with the Bhāṣya'.

13. The adjective 'particular' is used to distinguish the sound from the subtle element of sound which is imperceptible to the senses.

14. The Vedanta doctrine of quintuplication is thus: First, one element is divided into two parts, and one part is again divided into four sub-parts; each of the four sub-parts is mixed with each of the remaining four elements. So on the basis of the quintuplica- tive process, each substance has a fivefold nature. The distinctive character of any element is determined on the basis of the fifty-per- cent element which predominates over the other lesser elements.

15. The purvapakṣin maintains that ākāśa which is all- pervasive and devoid of parts is not at all produced since there is difference of opinion in the scriptural texts regarding this topic. But this view is rejected by Sri Ramanuja (cf. Commentary on VS. II, iii, 3) since the Veduntasutras and śrutis establish the origina- tion of ether (cf. Taitt. Up. II, 1; Mund Up. II, i, 4). Moreover, a contradictory inference has no force when the point in question is established by Scripture.

16. The sense of this sentence is not clear; for the mani- festation of prana is weak in the case of non-ambulants. The Telugu edition of the work has here a different reading, according to which the passage means 'that the restriction of function is only in respect of ambulants. But in respect of non-ambulants there is prāna in them but it is feeble'.

Although prabha is a quality of an effulgent object, it is in itself a kind of substance, and not bare quality like redness; for it can exist apart from its substrate and possesses colour as an attribute. It is called substance because it illumines itself and other objects; and attribute, because it always depends upon its substrate.

18. "That Divinity having entered into these three beings differentiated names and forms. Each of these being it rendered tripartite.' (Cha. Up., V, iii, 3 and 4).

19. 'Any substance which a sentient soul is capable of com- pletely controlling and supporting for its own purposes, and which stands to the soul in an entirely subordinate relation, is the body of the soul'. (Sribhāṣya, II, i, 9, and S.B.E., XLVIII, part III, p. 424).

20. The lakṣaṇa which is different from the essential nature of the object defined, and yet is the definition by which the object is defined is called taṭasthalakṣaṇa.

21. The definition that body is the seat of activity has the defect of over-pervasion, since a jar also would be a sarira as it is the seat of activity.

22. The definition that body is the seat of sense organs is too narrow as it does not include the organless bodies of stone and wood, and many other physical organisms devoid of sense organs. For instance, the stone-body bestowed on Ahalya.

23. The definition of body that it is what causes the enjoy- ment of the results of actions does not serve the purpose since it excludes 'earth' etc. which the Upanisad texts declare to be the sarira of the Antaryamin. Further, the aprakṛta forms which Isvara assumes by His wish as well as the bodily forms of the nityasūris are not the fruition of any karma.

24. The definition that body is the aggregate of head, hands, feet, etc., is ridiculous as it includes all inanimate images and figure.

25. Saubhari who was endowed with special powers could assume bodies simultaneously.

26. This may be compared to the simile of the snake and its coils.

8. Dissolution is fourfold: nitya, naimittika, prākṛta and atyantika. Nityapralaya is sleep in which every effect dissolves for the time being. Naimittikapralaya is the dissolution at the termination of Brahma's day. Prakṛtapralaya takes place at the end of every epoch of Brahma. Atyantikapralaya is release from the bondage of matter when the jiva realizes God.

9. There are two kinds of time: akhaṇḍakala (impartite time) and karyakala (time as effect). The former is eternal and is the cause of the effected time, whereas the latter, which we experience in our ordinary life, is changing and non-eternal.

10.

10. When Isvara in sport creates, sustains and withdraws the entire universe, time serves as an instrument in His cosmic functions.

11. Līlāvibhuti is the sport of Isvara which consists in the production, sustentation and absorption of the entire universe. In the language of the Upanisads He becomes Sat and Tyat, i.e., He who was the Self in the causal state interpenetrates the world in its effected state also as the Self of all temporal objects.

    Nityavibhuti is Vaikuntha, the spiritual universe, in which time is dependent on the will of Isvara. As Prof. P. N. Srinivasa- chari puts it, 'The lilavibūti, the world of splendour which exists for the sport of the Lord, is the play of the eternal in the temporal and the nityavibhuti or eternal splendour of paramapada is time as eternity....In the former, time is finite and effected by the gunas, while in the latter, it is not causally related, but is infinite and beyond the place of space-time' (The Philosophy of Visistadvaita, p. 498).

1. Suddhasattva is a kind of spiritual matter which exists in the Highest Heaven. It is identical with nityavibhuti. As Dr. Schrader says, it is a necessary hypothesis for explaining (i) the aprakṛta bodies of Isvara, nityas and muktas; and (ii) the presence of the 'means of enjoyment' in Vaikuntha.

2. For the definiton of dharmabhütajñana, the attributive consciousness, see the seventh avatara.

3. Dharmabhūtajñāna and suddhasattva are called parak or external, since they appear for others only and never for themselves. That is, they are self-luminous and manifest for the sake of the individual self which is self-conscious.

4. For a clear conception of pañcasakti see Padmatantra, XII, 36ff. According to this verse Vişņu himself is called pañcaśaktimaya. The saktis are sarva, nivṛtti, viśva, purusa and parameṣṭhi.

5. The six attributes are jñana (knowledge), sakti (might), bala (strength), aiśvarya (dominion), virya (energy) and tejas (splendour).

7. 'God speed you (in your journey) beyond across the darkness!' (Mund. Up., II, ii, 6).

8. Jñānātmakatva means svayamprakasakatva, self-luminosity. 9. The astrabhuṣaṇa-adhyaya of Visnupurana (1, 22) is a great authority on this subject. The ornaments and weapons which adorn the body of the Divine Figure symbologically represent the principles of the universe.

    ### AVATARA SEVEN

    DHARMABHUTAJÑANA

1. Consciousness is not identical with the being, but is the attribute of an individual self. Hence it cannot be held that being is not the object of consciousness. But it may be admitted that the knowing individual self is not the object of consciousness at the time when it is manifesting other objects. But an absolute rule cannot be made since the knowledge of one person may become the object of the knowledge of another or that one's state of con- sciousness may become the object of his own apprehension. So it cannot be maintained without deviation that consciousness is self- proved because it is consciousness. In the words of Sri Rāmānuja the true meaning of svayamprakasatva is that 'the essential nature of consciousness-or knowledge-consists therein that it shines forth, or manifests itself, through its own being to its own substrate at the present moment; or (to give another definition) that it is instrumental in proving its own object by its own being' (S.B.E., XLVIII, part III, p. 48).

2. 'It is like physical light which can only show but cannot know. (See P. N. Srinivasachari's Philosophy of Visisṭādvaita,

   p. 29.) (See F

3. It has already been told that one substance, say, fire can subsist in twofold form as light (prabha) and luminous substance

   190

   (prabhavan). Although it is an attribute inhering in a substance, it is itself nothing but substance as the locus of colour etc. Ana- logously though consciousness is the attribute of individual self, it may be defined as a substance since it is a viṣayin, being the sub- strate of contraction and expansion.

4. Though consciousness is vibhu it becomes limited in the phenomenal state of existence owing to the influence of karma. In the state of liberation it becomes all-pervasive and infinite, being freed from the contraction due to karma.

5. When a sense organ or a light manifests an object, it does not require any sense organ or light for its function.

6. Since sense of sight and light have sättvikähankara and tejas for their substance, they cannot be classified under the same genus.

7. When there is a. repeated cognition of one and the same object, for instance, a pillar, there is no splitting up of conscious- ness in which the succeeding one comes into existence after the destruction of the prior one. But so long as there is the presentation of one and the same object in all succeeding moments, the con- sciousness persists as one single stream.

8. It is believed that some particular variety of gems have the power of neutralizing the burning property of fire.

9. Br. Up., I, v, 3.

10.

Nirandhra literally means 'without any hole'.

11. Firm meditation on God which is compared to the un- interrupted flow of oil is called bhakti or upasana; when such meditation, characterized by sakṣātkāra, is daily practised till the last moment of death, it becomes the means for the realization of the beatific form of the Supreme Deity. This is in agreement with the Chandogya passage (VII, xxvi, 2) which declares 'on the attain- ment of recollection, all the knots are loosened'. In this connec- tion the Bhāṣyakara derives support from the Vakyakara who declares, 'Meditation is steady remembrance, on the ground of meditation and statement' (S.B.E., XLVIII, part III, p. 15).

12. The eight well-known limbs of yoga as enumerated by Patanjali are meant to control the mind from its outgoing tenden- cies, and help it to attain the one-pointed concentration. Yama is the moral discipline of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence and non-receiving of gifts or favours (YS., II, 30).NOTES AND REFERENCES

    191

    Niyama is self-purification, satisfaction, austerities, study and contemplation of God (Ibid., II, 32). Asana or posture is that which is firm and pleasant (Ibid., II, 46). A firm seat enables one to control the respiratory functions: Pranayama is the control of the motions of expiration and inspiration (Ibid., II, 49). Mastery of respiratory functions helps one to attain control over the vital airs of the body. Pratyahāra is the withdrawal of the sense organs from their objects and assuming the real form of the mind-stuff (Ibid., II, 54). If the mind is not allowed to contact with the external objects, it will remain tranquil. When the mind is arrested from its outgoing tendencies, it can stick to some object. Dharaṇā is focussing the mind to some particular object (Ibid., III, 1). When consciousness, devoid of forms, illumines only the content, it is called samadhi (Ibid., III, 3).

13. The sadhanasaptaka has been quoted by Śrī Rāmānuja in the Sribhāṣya (I, i, 1) as the words of Vakyakara (identified with Tankācārya Brahmanandin) who declares them to be the means for bhakti in the form of steady remembrance.

14. Food becomes impure by three defects: Flesh of animals etc., come under jātidoṣa while food coming from improper source, say, a fallen person, has the defect of aśraya. Leavings of food or such food into which some impure thing has fallen has the defect of nimitta or causal. Mental purity is preceded by physical purity. This is consistent with the Chandogya passage (VII, 26) which declares that when the body is pure, the mind is pure, and with the attainment of mental purity dhruvasmrti or mental concentra- tion results.

15. Freedom from the web of desires is essential for achiev- ing the calmness of mind, and without mental tranquillity it is not possible to meditate on Brahman. Hence the śruti declares, 'Let him meditate with calmness of mind' (Cha. Up., III, xiv, 1).

16. Repetition of steady remembrance of Brahman results from the mental tranquillity. In this connection Bhāṣyakara Dramiḍācārya is quoted in the Sribhāṣya as declaring the famous Bhagavadgita passage, 'Constantly absorbed in the thought of that object' (VIII, 8).

17. Even at this stage the neophyte is not free from the social and moral obligations. Further, the fivefold duties serve as

    192

    YATINDRAMATADIPIKĀ

    the means for the realization of Brahman. Sri Ramanuja quotes the following passages as authorizing this view: 'The performer of virtuous actions is the best among the knowers of Brahman' (Mund. Up., III, i, 4), and 'The Brahmanas seek to know Him through the recitation of the Veda, sacrifices, charity, penance and fasting' (Br. Up., IV, iv, 22).

18. Kalyana is the practice of the inner virtues which are indispensable to spiritual life. This is confirmed by the Vedanta texts, such as 'He is to be attained by truth, real knowledge and continence' (Mund. Up., II, i, 5), and 'Verily, Brahmaloka is for those who are endowed with penance and continence and in whom truth is established. To them belongs the pure world of Brahman in whom there is neither deceit, untruth or guile' (Pras. Up., I, 15 & 16).

19. Anavasada is freedom from low spirits owing to un- favourable conditions of time or place and recollection of sorrows. Since dejection is an obstacle in the path of divine life, the śruti declares, 'The Atman cannot be attained by one devoid of strength' (Mund. Up., III, ii, 4).

20. As excessive exultation is the positive obstacle in the way of meditation, the Upanisad states, 'He who knows Him becomes calm, subdued' etc. (Br. Up., IV, iv, 23).

21. When the upasaka, equipped with the discipline of sadhanasaptaka continues his meditation, which has acquired the vividness of darśana, to the last moment of his consciousness, he perceives the beatific form of the Divine just prior to the exit from the present body. This is called antimapratyaya.

22. Even after the dawn of bhakti the antimapratyaya may not come owing to the non-extinction of the prarabdha. 'Hence the upasaka has to wait till the exhaustion of his prarabdha.

23. This has reference to the famous passage, 'The Self, my dear Maitreyi, is to be seen, to be heard, to be reflected upon, to be meditated upon' (Br. Up., IV, v, 6), which contains the instruc- tion of meditation. Just as the clause, 'the Self is to be heard', is a confirmation of what is already established by some other means, the clause, 'the Self is to be reflected upon', is a confirmation of what is already established by 'hearing'. The first two clauses refer to the sentence-generated knowledge subserving 'meditation' which itself is declared by the clause, 'the Self is to be meditated upon".

    NOTES AND REFERENCES

    193

    The aphorism which authorizes this point is 'Reflection more than once, on account of instruction' (VS., IV, i, 1). In this connection Sri Ramanuja says that 'knowledge', which is the means of release, is of the nature of 'meditation', since the terms 'knowing' and 'meditating' are interchangeably used in the former and latter portion of the Vedanta texts; for instance, 'One should meditate on mind as Brahman', and 'He who knows this shines and warms through celebrity, fame and Brahmavarcas' (Cha. Up., III, xviii, 1 and 6).one

    W. 24. The Upanisads embody thirty-two kinds of Brahmavidya which enjoin that the only object of meditation is Brahman and not matter or the jiva. They also prescribe the method of intuiting Brahman for those desirous of release. Besides certain kinds of attributes which are common to all the vidyas, each vidya embodies one or more special attributes of Brahman, which distinguishes it from the others. Of late, attempts have been made to classify the vidyas along with their Vedanta texts and with the Vedantasütras in which they are treated. Mr A. Srinivasa Raghavan of Pudu- kottah has given a list of the thirty-two vidyas with reference to their respective Upanisad texts and the Vedantasütras in his edition of Sri Sariraka Adhikarana Ratnamälä. The references to the vidyas mentioned below have been traced in accordance with this list.

25. Antarkaṣividya is not found in the list prepared by Mr. Srinivasa Raghavan. This may be identical with akṣisthasatya- brahmavidya, embodied in the text, 'Satya is Brahman....the being who abides in the orb of the sun and in the right eye' (Br. Up., V, 5), and discussed in the third chapter of the Vedantasūtras (iii, 20).

    and

26. One of the texts that deal with daharavidya is, 'In this city of Brahman there is the palace, the small lotus, and within it the small ākāśa. What is within it is to be sought after, for that is to be known' (Cha. Up., VIII, i, 1). This topic is dealt with in I, iii, 13, and III, iii, 38 of the Vedantasütras. This vidya, after declaring that the ākāśa within the lotus of the heart is neither elemental nor jiva, but Brahman, praises the Infinite who, owing to His boundless love towards the devotees, becomes the finite in the hearts of all beings as the object of meditation.

    194

27. The conception of Brahman as Bhuman is embodied in the passage, 'Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, knows nothing else, that is Infinite' (Cha. Up., VII, 24 and VS., I, iii, 7). This vidya teaches the knowledge of Brahman as Bhuman and concludes that he who intuits Brahman as the Self of all 'loves the Self, delights in the Self, revels in the Self, rejoices in the Self; he becomes svarāṭ'.

28. Sadvidya is taught by the text, 'In the beginning, my dear, Being only was this, one only without a second' (Cha. Up. VI, ii, 1 and VS., I, i, 5). Sadvidya establishes that the cause of the World is Brahman, denoted by the term 'Sat', and not pradhana assumed by the others on the basis of inference.

29. "Verily, this sun is the honey of the devas.... He who knows this nectar becomes one of the vasus' (Cha. Up., III, 1 and VS., I, iii, 30). Madhuvidya teaches that the sun is called madhu or nectar as he is the abode of nectar; and he who meditates on the sun in the above manner procures the position of vasu etc.

30. 'The person that is in the eye, that is the Self; this is the immortal, the fearless, this Brahman' (Cha. Up., IV, xv, 1 and VS., 1, ii, 13). Here upakosalavidya teaches that the Person seen in the eye is none but Brahman since all the beings go to Him. He is called Vamani and Bhamani as He conveys blessings to the devotees and shines in all the worlds.

    and 31. All this is Brahman. One should meditate upon the world with calm mind as beginning, ending and continuing in Brahman' (Cha. Up., III, xiv, 1 and VS., I, i, 1). Sanḍilyavidya teaches that one has to meditate on the world as having its self in Brahman inasmuch as cit and acit are His attributes.

32. Puruṣavidya or paramapuruṣavidya is in other words. known as trimatrapranavavidya. According to Govindācārya- svamin the relevant Upanisad text that embodies this vidya begins with 'Ṛtam pibantau sukṛtasya loke' and ends with 'purusanna param kiñcit sa kaṣṭhā să para gatih' (Katha Up., III, 1-11). But according to Mr. Srinivasa Raghavan the Vedanta text that elucidates this vidya is, 'He again who meditates on the Supreme Purusa by the syllable Om of three matras reaches the sun....he sees the Person dwelling in the city who is higher than the indi- vidual selves' (Pras. Up., V, 5 and VS., I, iii, 12). This vidya

    NOTES AND REFERENCES

    195

    declares that the Paramapuruşa referred to in this context is not Caturmukha-Brahma, the aggregate of the individual selves, but the highest Brahman. From this Vidya we understand that he who meditates on the Pranava with one syllable attains the world of mortals, with two syllables, the heavens and with trisyllabic Pranava which represents Brahman, he reaches Paramapuruşa, the highest Brahman.

33. 'At present you know the Vaiśvānara Self, tell us that ....but he who meditates on the Vaiśvānara Self as Prādeśa- matra' etc., (Cha. Up., V, xi, 6; xviii, 1 and VS., I, ii, 25). In this vidya the object of meditation is none but the Supreme Brahman. The upasaka who meditates on Vaiśvānara as having the uni- verse for His body becomes purified as declared in the passage, 'Just as the fibres of the isikä reed would burn when thrown into fire, similarly the sins of the vidvän are burnt' (Cha. Up., V, xxiv, 3). 34. The connected Upanisad text, "Those who know this, and those who in the forest meditate upon śraddha and tapas go to light' (Cha. Up., V, 10) is discussed in the third chapter of the VS. This vidya declares that all those who practise meditation go on the path of devas to reach Brahman.

35. "He who at the beginning created Brahma, who delivered the Vedas unto him-I, seeking liberation, go for refuge to that effulgent One' (Svet. Up., VI, 18). Nyasavidya inculcates the doctrine of absolute self-surrender to Iévara by the renunciation of every material consideration.

36. Vide Ahirbudhnyasamhita, XXXVII, ii, 27 and 28.

37. A distinction is made between bhakti and prapatti. While bhaktiyoga is a classical process which generates devotion by means of the severe sevenfold discipline, prapatti provides a simple and easy path for the weak, erring humanity. The bhakta has to fling himself but once at the feet of Bhagavan: the saving grace and mercy will not be far off. Since this act of self-resignation has immediate effect, even the prarabdha-karma is annihilated, and the sadhaka need not have to wait for another body for liberation. Further, while the arduous path of bhakti demands continued practice of meditation till the last moment of death, prapatti ex- cludes the necessity of such continued representation by a single supreme act.

The Carvākas are those materialists who identify the 'self' with the body.

39. This is the view of the Vijñānavādins. When the pre- ceding momentary consciousness has perished, the subsequent momentary consciousness originates; hence there is no causal relation between the two. -8

40. The Jainas hold that the entire complex of things is of a Pyrrhonian nature inasmuch as any attribute can be predicated about an object. To prove that all things are characterized by permanence and non-permanence, existence and non-existence, they put forward the following seven paralogisms: May be, it is, May be, it is not, May be, it is and is not, May be, it is not predicable, May be, it is and is not predicable, May be, it is not and is not predicable, May be, it is and is not, and is not predicable. (Vide S.B.E., Vol. XLVIII, part III, p. 517).

41. According to this system the individual self in its state of liberation loses all its special attributes including that of pleasure

    tes including that also.

42. According to māyāvāda everything has only an empirical reality save Brahman; consequently the knowledge of Brahman that arises from the study of the empirical texts cannot be final, valid

    or eternal.

43. Bhaskara and Yadava, who uphold the doctrine of identity in difference, believe that a co-ordination of jñana and karma is necessary for the intution of Brahman. This view is rejected since 'meditation' is alone admitted to be the means for liberation.

44. This refers to certain strange practices such as smearing oneself with the ashes of a corpse, eating its flesh, using a skull as

    JIVA

1. If jiva is merely defined as 'sentient', there will be over- pervasion inasmuch as Iévara also is sentient; hence the attribute of 'sesatva'.

   NOTES AND REFERENCES

   197

2. Srinivasa very clearly defines the concept of jiva by dis- tinguishing it from the definition of the dehätmavādin who con- tends that body is the jIva; from the indriyatmavädin who holds that sense organs are identical with the jiva; from the prapat- mavādin who contends that the pranas constitute the jiva; and finally from the antaḥkaraṇātmavadin who maintains that the jiva is cit delimited by the mind.

3. The śruti states that the jiva passes out of the body at the time of death and again enters it at the time of birth. (Vide VS., II, iii, 20.) If the jiva is omnipresent, this passing out of the body etc., are not possible. The relevant texts that confirm the 'passing out' and 'returning' are as follows: "The self departs by that light (of the heart) either through the eye, or through the head, or through other parts of the body (Br. Up., IV, iv, 2), and 'he returns from that world to this world for action' (Br. Up., IV, iv, 6).

4. The definition that the jiva is aņu does not mean that it has the limitation of a bare monad. In our ordinary experience we find that the light of a luminous body can extend beyond its substrate. Similarly this all-pervasive and infinite consciousness of the jiva can radiate from its nucleus without any limitation.

5. 'The intelligent one is not born, nor it dies' (Katha Up., II, 18).

6. The connection of the jivas with various bodies is due to the karma of those jivas. The Upanisad states, 'the doer of good works becomes good, the doer of bad works becomes bad. He becomes virtuous by virtuous deeds, vicious by vicious deeds' (Br. Up., IV, iv, 5).

7.

Although the souls, as being parts of Brahman and so on, are of essentially the same character, they are actually separate; for each of them is of atomic size and resides in a separate body. For this reason there is no confusion or mixing up of the individual spheres of enjoyment and experience' (S.B.E., vol. XLVIII, part III, p. 565).

8. The limiting adjunct which binds the individual self is avidya which is of the nature of karma, accumulated by the jiva in its previous births.

9. The agent is the jiva and not the gunas since, Scripture declares 'he who is desirous of heaven should sacrifice'. Vide also

   198

   YATINDRAMATADĪPIKĀ

   VS., II, iii, 33: (The soul is) an agent, on account of Scripture (thus) having a purport.' Moreover, if the activity belonged to prakṛti and not to jiva, then it would follow, that, since prakrti is connected with all the jivas, everyone would experience all actions. 10. While the saririn is the controller (niyanta) and sup- porter (adhāra) of the body, the sarira is the supported (adheya) and the controlled (niyamya). Just as the physical body, composed of the five elements, constitutes the body of the jiva, the jiva also in its turn forms the body of Iévara on the basis of adhara-adheya and niyantr-niyamya principle. Thus the jiva is the body and the indweller of the body from two points of view.

11. The view that each jiva has the same size as the body it occupies has a serious defect; for it the jiva, which was commen- surate with the body of an elephant, has to enter into the body of an ant, it would become incomplete as it then occupies less space. See Sribhāṣya, II, ii, 33.

    35 12. If, according to Yadavaprakasa and Bhaskara, Brahman abides in the form of subject, object of enjoyment and ruler, or Brahman becomes the jiva by. a real upadhi, all the imperfections and defects of the jiva would become Brahman's also.

13. The ekajivavādin contends that the entire world is fabri- cated by the avidya of a single self. He does not predicate multi- plicity of the apparently conditioned consciousness.

14. The anekajivavädin maintains the multiplicity of the apparently finite consciousness on empirical grounds; he holds that the jivas are as many as the internal-organs which limit and define the supreme homogeneous Consciousness. Vide Vedantaparibhāṣā, 'tatra jivo nama antaḥkaraṇāvacchinna-caitanyam'.

15. It has been already pointed out that though the jiva is not vibhu, its consciousness has not the limitation of a monad. If the jiva can be compared to a light-house, its consciousness is like the powerful beams of light which can extend to distant places. Thus though the jiva is limited to one place, its consciousness can inter-penetrate and pervade other realms.

16. "He who behaves thus throughout his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return-he does not return' (Cha. Up., VIII, 15).

    YATINDRAMATADIPIKA

    In the beautiful language of Visnupurana (V, viii, 30), Brahman leads the jiva towards atmabhava like the magnet which attracts the iron; hence there is no loss of personality just as the attracted body does not become one with the attracting body. Bhagavadgitā also says that mukta attains the attributes like Brahman (XIV, 2). The author of the Dramiḍabhagya declares that the mukta, owing to his sayujya with Brahman, effects all things like Him.

32. If sayujya means identity with Brahman, it follows that the power of creation, sustentation and destruction of the world must be attributed to the liberated self. To this the Vedantasūtras” reply is: 'With the exception of cosmic functions' (IV, iv, 17). Moreover, the Upanisad texts mention the power of ruling, controll- ing, etc., with reference to Brahman alone. The Vṛttikära also declares that with the exception of cosmic functions, the mukta is equal to Brahman through light.

33. 'Non-return according to Scripture' (VS., IV, iv, 22), and 'He who behaves thus throughout his life reaches the world of Brahman and does not return' (Cha., VIII, 15). In this con- nection Sri Ramanuja says, 'As, moreover, the released soul has freed itself from the bondage of karman, has its powers of know- ledge fully developed, and has all its being in the supremely blissful intution of the highest Brahman, it evidently cannot desire any- thing else nor enter on any other form of activity, and the idea of returning into samsara therefore is altogether excluded' (S.B.E., vol. XLVIII, part III, p. 771).J

   effect and cause, and the world thus has Brahman for its material cause' (S.B.E., vol. XLVIII, part III, p. 142).

3. Three causes bring about the origination of an object, viz., the upadana-cause, the nimitta-cause and the sahakarin-cause. For example, in the production of a pot, earth is the upādāna- karana, potter the nimittakarana and the potter's wheel and other accessories the sahakarana. On the other hand for the origination of the universe, Iévara Himself solely constitutes all the three causes. 4. The following objection is raised: The Vedanta text, 'Being only was this in the beginning' (Cha. Up., VI, ii, 1), teaches that 'Being', which denotes the cause of the universe, is nothing but prakrti inasmuch as the word 'this' indicates the effected state comprising sattva, rajas, tamas, etc. Since the non-difference of cause and effect has been accepted, the cause must be prakṛti which comprises the three elements of sattva, rajas and tamas. This view is rejected as it is not based upon the śruti; for the śruti expresses a kind of mental activity on the part of the 'Being' as stated in the text, 'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth' (Cha. Up., VI, ii, 1). Therefore the non-sentient prakrti devoid of 'thinking' cannot be the cause of the universe.

5. According to this canon of interpretation the term 'animal' connotes 'goat' in connection with the sacrifice called daikaa-pasu. 6. According to this nyaya all general terms must find their ultimate significance and meaning in a particular term.

7. Objection raised by the Advaitin.

8. Let us take for instance two apparently contradictory sets of Vedanta texts: the text, 'Now, if a person meditates on another God thinking "he is one and I another", he does not know' (Br. Up., II, iv, 6) dispels the notion that jiva and Brahman are different, while the texts, "The Lord of the pradhana and the in- dividual selves' (Svet. Up., VI, 16) and 'The ruler of all, the Lord of the selves' (Mahānār. Up., XI, 3) declare difference in the nature of jiva and Brahman. When we are confronted with such con- flicting texts, Ghatakaśrutis enable us to understand the correct relation free from seeming contradiction. The text, 'He who dwells within the Self, but is different from it, whom the Self does not know, whose body is the Self, who controls the Self from within; he is thy Self, the inner Ruler, the immortal one' (Br. Up., III,

   202

   YATINDRAMATADĪPIKĀ

   vii, 22), establishes that Brahman is the Self of all inasmuch as all beings have their origin, sustentation and absorption in Him and constitute His body, Since every jiva constitutes the body of Brah- man, and Brahman constitutes the Self of jIva, there is no real contradiction in the relation between jiva and Brahman. The abheda texts deny difference in so far as jiva is of the nature of Brahman. The bheda texts affirm difference in so far as Brahman is different from jiva in the same way as jiva is different from its body. Likewise, the text, "Thou art that' does not affirm the essen- tial unity of jiva with Brahman. "Thou' and 'That' refer to Brahman qualified by difference. The term "That' denotes Brahman intro- duced before as, "It thought "may I be many", and the term "Thou' refers to Brahman in so far as having for His body cit related with acit. Thus the relation of sarira-saririn harmonizes the apparent contradiction between jIva and Brahman.

9. For example, Mundaka Upanisad (I, i, 6) in the first half of the mantra denies Brahman of all the qualities related to matter, and in the second half defines Brahman as possessing eternality, all-pervasiveness, subtlety, imperishableness, creativeness, etc.

10. It may be objected that on the basis of sarira-saririn relation, all the imperfections of the sentient beings and the non- sentient matter may cling to Brahman, and consequently Visistäd- vaita is wrong in ascribing material causality to Brahman. Visiṣṭād- vaita repudiates the idea of Brahman being related even with the shadow of evil. Since Brahman constitutes the Self of the universe- body, namely, cit and acit, it is quite consistent to hold that Brah- man's body is connected with two states, i.e., causal and effected, the nature of which are contraction and expansion. In ordinary life we observe that the states of childhood, youth, old age, etc., effect the body only, while bliss, knowledge, etc., belong to the self. Similarly, the imperfections adhering to cit and acit do not belong to Brahman, and the special attributes of Brahman do not extend to cit and acit. tanto sow walent A

11. The theory of Vyüha, which is one of the foundational doctrines of the Päñcaratra, forms part and parcel of the Viṣiṣṭă- dvaita conception of the Deity. Sankarṣana emanates from Vasu- deva, Pradyumna from Sankarṣana and Aniruddha from Pradyu- mna. In the language of the Pañcaratra the manifestation is like

    *one flame proceeding from another flame'. As Dr. Schrader points out, the word is a combination of the root uh 'to shove' and the preposition vi 'asunder' meaning 'to shove asunder' of the six gunas into three pairs. Though each Vyūha is the manifestation of the highest Divine qualified by all the six gunas, it however, is characterized by two predominant gunas. Further, each Vyuha has two sets of activities-cosmic and ethical. Sri Ramanuja informs us (VS. II, ii, 42) of another aspect of the Vyuha, referred to in the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Santiparvan of the Mahabharata. In this alternate view Sankarṣana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the beings ruling over the individual selves, internal organs and organs of egoity; and consequently Sankarṣaṇa is denoted by jiva, Pradyu- mna by manas and Aniruddha by ahankara. at topp

12. Vasudeva the highest Self possesses all the six guņas, namely, jñāna (knowledge), aiśvarya (lordship), sakti (potency), bala (strength), virya (virility) and tejas (splendour). Cf. Lakṣmi- tantra (VI, 25) 'Sadgunyavigraham devam'.

13. The activities of Sankarṣana are to destroy the universe and propound the scriptures.

14. Pradyumna creates the universe and introduces all the dharmas (dharmanayanam).

15. Aniruddha protects the creation and makes known the tattva (tattvam jñāpayati). Or as Dr. Schrader states, 'the ethical activities of the three Vyühas are declared to be teaching (1) by Sankarṣana of the Sastra or "theory", namely, of monotheism (ekāntikamärga); (2) by Pradyumna, of its translation into practice (tatkriya); and (3) by Aniruddha, of the gain resulting from such practice (kriya-phala), to wit, liberation' (I, Pañ., pp. 38-39).

16. Vasudeva hypostastizes into Kesava, Nārāyaṇa and Madhava, Sankargana into Govinda, Vişņu and Madhusudana, Pradyumna into Trivikrama, Vamana and Sridhara, and Aniruddha into Hrişikeṣa, Padmanabha and Damodara,

18. The ten principal avatars are Matsya, Kürma, Varaha, Nrsimha, Vamana, Parasurama, Rama, Balabhadra, Krsna and Kalkin. According to Visvaksenasamhita and Lakṣmitantra all the avatars descend from the fourth Vyuha, namely, Aniruddha. But

    Padmatantra declares that of the ten Vibhavas, Matsya, Kürma and Varaha descend from Vasudeva, Nrsimha, Vamana, Śrīrāma and Parasurama from Sankarṣaṇa, Balarama from Pradyumna, and Śrikṛṣṇa and Kalkin from Aniruddha. (Vide I. Pāñ., p. 48).

19. The great devotee Prahlad who had taken refuge in Narayana is referred to here.

20. Pralamba was an asura who assured the form of a cowherd, and joined the band of cowherds with a view to destroy Krsna and Balarama. Krsna knowing the motive of the asura, arranged a sham-fight, the result of which was the members of Krsna's party who were the vanquished had to carry on their back the members of Balarama's party who were the winners. It so happened that Balarama was carried by Pralamba. The asura, who assumed his real form, began to fly in the air with Balarama. But Balarama hammered the head of the asura and made him fall down. Likewise he killed Dhenuka who came in the form of an ass. 21. According to Ahirbudhnyasamhita the avatars are thirty- nine; they are as follows:

Dr. Schrader informs us that the Vibhavas are thirty-nine according to Satvatasamhita also. But our author, following Varavaramuni, admits thirty-six Vibhavas only, since Kapila, Dattatreya and Parasurama are supposed to be secondary avatars.

22. The avatar of Dadhibhakta was assumed with a view to grant the nectar.

23. The avatar of Hayagriva was undertaken for delivering the Vedas.

24. The avatar of Naranarayana was assumed in the form of student and preceptor with a view to impart the esoteric doctrines.

25. The mukhya-avatar is supposed to be the Isvara himself in a spiritual body, whereas the avatar of gauna or aveśa is said to be a self in a material body which is possessed by the power of the Isvara for some particular purpose.kap w

26. The aspirants who seek liberation are advised to worship the primary or mukhya avatars only, and not the secondary ones, since the latter constitute the locus of such selfs which are quali- fied by egoism.

27. The authority for this conception is the passage of the Gitä which states 'I come into being by My own maya' (VI, 6). 'By My own maya' is to be taken as 'By My own will'.

2. Since sabda cannot serve as a material cause, it is viewed as a non-substance.

4. Vide Cha. Up., VI, iv, 1. According to this text fire has only three colours, namely, red, white and black.

5. The Naiyayikas postulate citrarupa (variegated colour) as a distinct variety.

6. The Vaiseṣikas hold that, when a pot is baked, even the constituent atoms are destroyed along with their properties; the new qualities are produced subsequently. This is known as 'Pilupǎkavāda' or 'the theory of atoms being baked'. On the contrary, the Naiyayikas hold that the constituent atoms are not destroyed in the process of baking. This theory is known as 'Piṭharapakavāda'.

7. Prakṛti, kala, suddhasattva, dharmabhütajñāna, jiva and Isvara.

8. For instance, when a monkey is hanging on the branch of a tree, the conjunction of the monkey with the tree may be said to be present and non-present in the same tree with reference to its top and bottom. This is known as avyapyavṛtti in Nyaya.

9. The Naiyayikas have to admit samyogaja-samyoga on the basis of the distinction between avayavin (composite whole) and avayavas (composite parts). As Visiṣṭadvaita does not admit such absolute difference between the whole and the parts, the contact of the hand with the book means the contact of the body with the book.

10. The Nyaya-Vaiseṣika theorists admit 'vibhāga' as a separate quality.

(Vide A Primer of Indian Logic, p. 16.)

15. There are three kinds of tendencies, namely, vega (speed), bhāvanā (reminiscent impression) and sthitisthāpaka (elasticity). The first belongs to earth, water, fire, air and mind; the second belongs to the individual self, and the third is the inclination of a thing to recover its original position when it is changed.

16. The Naiyayika's conception of the twenty-four gunas is redundant. Since vibhaga is nothing but the absence of samyoga, it cannot come under any special classification. Paratva and aparatva cannot be explained apart from space-time relation. As pointed out by Mm. S. Kuppusvāmi Sastrin, but for the realistic phobia. of the Nyaya-Vaiseşika thinkers to find a corresponding objective reality for every thought in their mind, there is hardly any need to give a distinct place for all these guņas.

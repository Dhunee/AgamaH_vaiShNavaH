N. B.-The Scheme of Transliteration is that adopt- ed by the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (JRAS,) except sh. Brahma-sūtras= Vedanta-sutras. It or He are both used for God and Soul. And She also, were it used, would, for Samskṛt, mean the same. The gender is incon- sequential. 

PREFACE. 

THE appearance of this work was adumbrated 

in the Artha-Pafcaka or The "Five Truths", in the pages of the JRAS (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society), p. 565, July 1910. It was to have appeared in the same Journal, but for paucity of space for a work extending over more than 45 pages. It was decided therefore to bring out an independent edition in India, which, as a book of reference for all time on the Višishţâ-'dvaita Philosophy and Religion, is expected to be more accommodating to the general reader than if it appeared in an academic Journal inaccessible to all. Being an academic work itself, the printing of it in propria forma demanded by the exigencies of Sarhskṛta orthography, was made possible by the Meykandan Press, under the supervision of its intelligent pro- prietor Mr. J. N. Ramanathan, of Madras, under- taking to meet all the requirements incidental to such a work. It is hoped the readers will find the justness of my remarks when they may come to examine it for themselves. 

2. In the shape of introduction to the work, very little need be written, it seeme to me, inasmuch

as scholars are more in need of original matter than attempts made at theses for which there seems at present no warranty. But if a popular introduction were yet deemed necessary, my work called the Vade Mecum of Vedanta affords an appropriate pourparler to the Yatindra-Mata-Dipika, the work which, with this preface, makes its debut into the arena of Indology. The necessity also for such preliminaries is as far as possible obviated by the copious foot-notes which will be found sprinkled in sufficient profusion, in almost every page, not only to elucidate the abstruse subject-matter but as well to reduce to the utmost minimum the jejune nature which is a sine qua non of all academic studies, the Oriental in a large measure. The desideratum for a separate glossary of technical terms which by necessity teem in all works of an academic nature, is met by the scheme, adopted in this work, of inditing all such terms side by side their English, in brackets or otherwise. Facilities for comprehension are better afforded, I trust, by this mode than if they had to be procured by constant references to glossary at the sacrifice of time, with mental poise liable to be ruffled by such a process of glossarial interference, at every step of a perusal. Strictest fidelity to the original Samskṛta might, it is feared, have led to the English rendering being found stiff and in places lacking, peradventure, in clarity. But this is due more to the 

PREFACE 

iii 

technical nature of the subject than to any perfunc- toriness on the part of the translator, who is conscious of having done his best. The subject itself is rigid, and invites the mental concentration of the student, not the surface-skimming of the light reader. 

3. With regard to the author of Yatindra-Mata: Dipikā, Šrinivāsa, we learn from the invocatory verses (left untranslated), where mention of Maha- "cārya in the preliminary of Advent I, synonymously referred to again as Ghana-guru-vara in the Colophon is made, that he, (viz., Šrinivasa) is the immediate disciple of Doḍday-arya, which is the colloquial of Mahâ-"ārya which is the same as Mahâ-"cārya. There is a succession of apostles of the Rāmānuja School beginning from Dāšarathi or Mudaliy-āṇḍān, Šri-Rāmānuja's sister's son, famed as of the Kandadai descent. To this stem belong all the Mahâ-"cāryas, a branch-an important one-settl- ing down at Ghatikâ-'cala, otherwise known as Chola simhapuram (vulgarised as Sholinghur,—a station on the Railway track linking Bangalur and Madras), which is referred to by Srinivasa, the author of Yatindra-Mata-Dipikā, as Ghatikâ-"dri, in his invocatory verse to the work. This place is a noted shrine, very ancient as having been sung by the archaic Azhvārs or Draviḍa Saints 

* See (my) Life of Ramanuja etc.

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

in their Tamil Works the Prabandhas-Nrsimha, one of the Ten Avatāras of Vishnu being the presid- ing Deity of the place. One of the Maha-"cāryas is noted in history as Canda-maruta Mahâ-"cärys by reason of a great polemical work called Canda- māruta (= hurricane) having been written by him on an anterior work the Šata-dushani of a similar charact- er, composed by the great Vedanta-"cārya [1268 A.C. born], who is the contemporary of Madhava or Vidya- ranya [1331 A.C. elected for Srigeri pontificate, in the now Mysore State]. The author mentions (in the Con- clusion-Chapter) both these works among others as those on which he bases his compendium of Višishta- 'dvaita Vedānta, viz., the Yatindra-Mata-Dipikā. Hence it may be reasonably conjectured that Šrinivasa is the immediate disciple of Ghatika-'cala Candamaruta Mahâ-"carya. This Mahâ-"carya is a contemporary of Appaya-Dikshita, who is a com- mentator on Vedanta-"carya's works. A tradition in currency further confirms this contemporaneity, which may be cited here, in almost the words kindly supplied me by my valued friend Šri M. T. Nara- simha-iyangar, B.A., M.R.AS., Professor in the Central College, Bangalūr:- 

"These two authors, Mahâ-"cārya and Appaya- Dikshita were close friends, both being the

unparalleled Vidvāns of the age; and they used to discuss philosophical questions very often, with a view to try their own skill in argument. Both were admirers of Vedanta-"carya, whose works they commented largely. Appaya-Dik- shita, as is well-known to all Sarhskṛt scholars, was a staunch devotee of Šiva, in spite of his having devoted his time to writing commentaries on the Višishţâ-"dvaitic works of Vedanta-"carya, and he wanted to construe the term Nārāyaṇa as applicable to his favourite deity Šiva. Maha- "cārya, seeing that his friend attempted a point (for argument) that could not at all be maintain- ed on grammatical basis (at most) waited for an opportunity to test the truth of his friend's conviction on the point in question. Once when they were both getting up the Alagar-malai about eight miles from Madura, (on which the temple of Sundara-bāhu or Alagar is situate, and where

Makesvare va jagatām adhišvare Janardane va jagad-antar-atmani Na vastu-bheda-pratipattir asta me Tatha-'pi bhaktis Tarun-endu-sekhare. 

The gist of the verse is that he saw no distinction between Šiva and Vishnu, yet he had a penchant for Šiva. See foot-note 238, page 116. [A. G.]vi

the famous Nupura-ganga rill runs), Maha- "carya took advantage of a position when he could extract the truth of his friend's conviction on the disputed point from his own mouth. Among the initial steps leading to the temple of Sundara-bahu, the eighteenth step from the bottom is regarded as presided over by a bhuta (spirit) named in Tamil Karappan; and the belief was that whoever speaks untruth (or proves false) while on this step, would suffer instantaneous death. (It is for this reason that the temple-keys used to be left, during nights, on this step, without any fear of thieves touch- ing them). (Here) Mahâ-"carya took hold of his friend's hand and making him stand there, questioned him thus:-"Tell me, my dear friend! are you really convinced that the term Nārāyaṇa can be construed as a name of Šiva? I ask you now because you cannot speak untruth here, for the sake of argument!" Then Appaya- Dikshita is said to have spoken out his own conviction to this effect: The letter N (") in the term Narayana is in the way of such con- struction. This is my conviction."*" 

* Appaya-Dikshita accedes to this confession, be- yond grammatical reasons merely, in his com- mentary on verse 35 of Ananda-lakari [Pp. 64-65.] 

PREFACE

This great Appaya-Dikshita's date is correctly known as 1552-1624 A. c. as proved by various evidences such as (1) his living at Vellore, under the patronage of Chinna Bomma Bhupala, (2) his being invited to the court of the Penukonda ruler Venkata- deva (1586-1613 AC); (3) his being the Vedanta teacher of the great grammarian Bhattoji-Dikshita, edited by R. Halasyanatha Sastrin, 1908. [Vāṇī-vilāsa Press, Srirangam] thus:- 

'Veda-vibhāga-'rtham evå 'vatirpena sakala-Veda- tātparyâ-'bhijñena sarvajña-šikhāmaņina bhagavatā Veda-Vyasena, Pulastya-vara-dana-labdha-devată- param-arthya-vedanena Šri-Parašareņâ, 'nyais ca mabarshibbir Ved-opa-bṛhmanâ-'rtham prapiteshu Šri Mahabharata-Vishnu-Purana-"dishu,

The gist of this passage is that his head will shatter into hundreds of fragments if he dared to gainsay the verdict of all the great Sages Vyāsa, Parāšara etc., about Nārāyaṇa being the Great God, in all their authoritative works; that he dare not commit such heresy and blasphemy, [A. G.]

(4) his antagonism with the famous poet Jagannatha Pandita or Pandita-raya, the author of Citra-mîmāṁsă- khandana, etc. 

We can therefore conclude that Mahâ-"cārya (who by tradition was equally old with Appaya- Dikshita, while the Alagar-malai incident took place, as chronicled above) lived in the latter part of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries. Our author Šrinivasa therefore, who is the son of Svami- pushkariņi Govinda-"rya, servitor at the Holy Hill Venkata-giri (Tirupati)-and disciple of Maha- "cārya, may be placed at the beginning of the 17th century. 

4 This author of Yatindra-Mata-Dipika had, according to the invocatory verse, a vision where he saw Venkatesa (the God of Tirupati), Devaraja (the God of Karisaila=Käñci), Nṛsithha (the God of Ghatika-"dri), along with Krshna (=Yamuna- "carya) and Yatirāja (= Rāmānuja), and that seems to be the inspiration quickening him to the com- position of an authoritative text-book, embodying in it all the quintessence of the doctrines of Visishţa- dvaita Philosophy and Religion promulgated by Šri Rāmānuja, which he fitly titles as the; YATINDRA MATA-DIPIKA or The Light of the School of Ramanuja.

and so vast as to be beyond the range of a clear conspectus of the subject-matter, necessity for com- pendia arose. Of such is the Yatindra-Mata-Dipikā, which purports to be a manual devised in order to present a lucid outline of the Visishta-'dvaita Philosophy and Religion, based on the voluminous literature extant, most of which the author Šrini- vāsa, mentions by name in the Conclusion-Chapter. I have inserted in brackets against these works, the names of these authors.* 

6. As handbooks were thus desiderated for original works, English renderings of such seem to be in requisition in these modern days of acute oriental research. The East and West are daily being brought into closer bonds. A memorable epoch of this process has just transpired in King George V of 'Britain having crowned himself with his august consort Queen Mary, on Indian soil in Dehli. Rshi Parašara, in giving an account of the kings of the future in his Vishpu-Purapa who would hold sway over India, wrote thus:- 

'Teshu'tsanneshu punaḥ Kainkilā Yavana bhüpatayo bhavishyanty a-murdhâ-'bhiskiktāḥ, [iv. 24. 55]. 

The word Kainkila has never been noticed as another variant by the learned editor of Wilson's 

Some of these were kindly traced out for me by my friend Prof. M. T. Narasimhiengar, Bangalur.

Vishnu-Purana, Mr. F. Hall. To my mind it sounds very much like (Angila). Kainkila-Yavanas then (to us) are the English people. They would rule, he further tells us, without wearing the crowns (a-murdha-'bhi- shikta). This is considered by the Hindus as unorthodox or un-normal. George V. coronating himself in India then is an event which restores to the Hindus its own notions and sentiments of what properly constituted sovereigns ought to be (ie., mūrdhâ-'bhishikta). May not the Rshi's prophecy point to the necessity of real crowned heads establishing themselves in India, instead of uncrowned vicegerents being permitted to fulfil royal functions? No literary work written during this Coronation epoch should hence launch out into the world without chronicling this world-event, an event conspiring to unite East and West in closer bonds of love for co-operative work in future. This is fostered by literary works of the East presented to the West in western garb. My present attempt is one more of this description. 

'Our task is to translate ancient knowledge into modern equivalents. We have to clothe the old strength in a new form. The new form without that old strength is nothing but a mockery; almost equal- ly foolish is the savage anachronism of an old- time power without fit expression. Spiritually, intel- lectually, there is no undertaking, but we must attempt it.' [Sister Nivedita alias Margaret E. Noble]. 

PREFACE

Also it is significant to note that as this work is being sent out on its career, the Government of India has resolved to take practical steps to en- courage Oriental Learning, judging from the Blue Book just published of the transactions of the Con- ference of Orientalists held in Simla, last July, under the presidentship of Sir S. Harcourt Butler, C.S.I., C.I.E., Member of Council for Education. 

7. Three Editions of the Yatindra-Mata-Dipikā have come to my knowledge:- 

(1) Published by the Vedanta-Vidya-Vilasa Press, Madras, 1868, in Telugu characters. 

(2) Published by the Vidya-tarangini Press, Mysore, 1896, in Telugu characters. 

(3) Pūna Ananda-"šrama Series, No. 50. 1906, with a commentary by Vasudeva Šastrin, in Devanagari. Varia lectiones is almost nil, but a good editon along with English translation seems a future contin- gency. The author has divided the work into Ten Avataras, ie., Incarnations, in allusion to the fact of Vishnu's (Nārāyaṇa's) Ten Incarnations. Con- forming with this sentiment, have I adopted the equivalent term Advent to mean Sections or Chapters. 

There are two Kārikās (versified works) treating of the same subject-matter (come to my notice), (1) Vedānta-kārika-"vali by Venkațârya, (2) Yatindra- siddhānta-sangraha by Sri-saila-"carya. [Vidya- tarangini Press, Maisir.]

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

As I stated above, the work, being academic, is rather rigid. I would therefore recommend the read- er to begin from the Fourth Advent to the End (prameya part), and then turn back to the First Three Advents (pramāna part). In any case the copious notes supplied will, it is hoped, lead to a clear comprehension of the otherwise intricate windings of the Višishțâ-'dvaita Philosophy and Religion.

8. Finally, I have to note that this addition to the Orientalia was finished on the 2nd of February 1912, the auspicious day on which a great festival is held in Melkote Hill (Tiru-Nārāyaça-puram), thirty miles north from Maisur (Mysore), in honour of Šri Rāmānuja having discovered the Holy Image of Nārāyaṇa overgrown with jungle and ant-hills, under the asterism Punarvasu (pollox). By acci- dent or providence, it is difficult for the small wits of man to divine, Rev. J. N. Farquhar of the Y. M. C. A. Calcutta, came just now for the first time to Maisûr and in his address to the public in the Wesleyan Mission School hall, began with the preliminary that what attracted him to the place was neither woodland nor river-scene, neither Darya-Daulats nor Tippu's Tombs, but that great Ramanuja who appeared ten centuries ago on this land giving to men a great spiritual

message.* On the day referred to (2nd February.) the Reverend gentleman, true to his announcement, was closeted with me for nearly two hours, in con- versation connected with Sri Ramanuja, and he inci- dentally referred to the lack of the ethical conception of God in the Vedanta, but I told him that the key-note of Ramanuja's teachings was pre-eminently that. This was the very point also, as I discovered, he had already put in print in his Primer of Hinduism, (p.42), where he says that 'in the Vedanta Philosophy there is one fatal omission that Brahman is not con- ceived as holy; we are nowhere told that Brahman is righteousness... .Hinduism remains from first to last crippled, because the idea of God was never moralised.' It is unfortunate Rev. Farquhar com- mitted himself thus too soon; for he would have made quite a contrary statement if he had written his Primer after his South Indian tour; for close

Already the morning dawn is upon us and we can see glimpses of the bright future reflected in our ability to know and appreciate each other's strength and excellence. [Philosophy of Theism.]

acquaintance with Rāmānuja would have startled him by his exposition of a most ethical and loving as well as sublime and exalted, God as surpasseth all notions of similar character that may be found en- shrined in other Scriptures of Earth. Unfortunately such appellations of Deity connoting His highly ethical character, seem to have escaped his the Revd's notice, viz., dharma, satya, punya, pāvana, pavitra, pūta, Suchi, suddha, siva, hari, kalyāņa, amale, apahata-pāpmā, beya-pratyanika, nish-kalanka antaryāmi,* Bhagavān † etc. This ethical concept is in fact the cardinal, salient, momentous feature of the Vedanta that con- stitutes Ramanuja's evangel to mankind.

knowledge, made available by Orientalists in this age of enlightenment and enlarged horizon, neither to gain nor glory does it redound to ignore the world-old traditions common to the Indo-European race. The outlook is now so wide that it is time the narrow bounds of Hebraism to which Christianity tenaciously clings itself, should be overleaped. The East invites all men to unite. Even as George V was crowned in India, the Universal Religion of all humanity is destined to be crowned here.* The Science of Religions by Emile Burnouf is a bracing revelation on this theme. Dr. Deussen, even without his reaching as far as Ṛāmānuja, says 'that there is not in the Bible (this venerable book being not yet quite free from Semitic realism) t; but it is in the

Max Muller in his Lectures on the Vedanta has shown the high ethical standard of the Vedanta, implicated in the doctrine of karma, which the Christian Church impugns to the detriment of all ethics, reducing God to the sorry predicament of a capricious, partial and cruel tyrant, violating as such all essentials of ethics. The Vedantic Deity, on the other hand, Max Muller shows, embraces the deities of any other religion.xvi

Vain again were its teachings of the immanency of Spirit, did it not mean a life of holiness to have to spring from it!!

Farquhar a fault venial in the bygone centuries, but not in this 20th century-passeth our under- standing. Nor will Hinduism in the least counten- ance such ethics (?) of the Christian Church as eternal damnation for petty sin or eternal salvation for petty virtue; both determined, indeed, by the infinitesimal life-span of man on earth, and projecting him for the nonce, into eternity for good or worse heedless of the ends of justice! The soul (ego) itself is an ethical entity to Vedanta (not sinful as Christiany insists, though God Himself breathed it!); a fortiori, God in Vedanta is essentially, primarily and exaltedly ethical.

the idea developed in Jesus the Christ's days, is still by ten centuries green. It is scientific to con- ceive the Kosmos as ceaselessly progressive; and therefore evolution need not be imagined as making an exception in the case of, Religion and Philosophy. Their progress therefore cannot be arrested at the Near East, Palestine. If the conservative of Christ be combined with the progressive of Ramanuja, in whom the germinal of the Veda finds its finale, the world is all the more a gainer. The collective reason of all religions so transmitted in history becomes the common heritage of all mankind. 

10. As the man of the Near East (Palestine) Jesus the Christ, was found ready to direct construction when northern barbarians pounced upon and destroy- ed the classical Roman Empire, the sun of Rāmānuja rose on the horizon of the Middle East (India) to direct construction when trans-, as well as cis,-Hima- layan influences such as the Persian (Assyrian also it is said), Semitic and Buddhistic, and all their con- geners had well-nigh sublimated the classic Vedic Brāhmaṇism. In this constructive work, Rāmānuja had also to contend against absolute monism and ergo consequential non-ethical character liable to be imputed to Godhood, into which Vedism had been volatilized, landing it in nihilism; and he had also

to establish the Personality of the Godhead as stand- ing in the most intimate relationship to the Ego (soul), for the redemption of which Divinity maketh repeat- ed loving sacrifices: Ajayamano bahudhā vijāyate, i. e., Incarnations*; and in order to prepare the same Ego for sweet eternal service comporting with Its Will. 

11. Ramanuja also found that men in his days had swerved from the unitarian conception of God, hidden under poetry, mythe or trope in the Archaic Vedas; and it was therefore his evangel to converge on to this unitarian focus the divergent lines of thought which had emerged from the Vedic source, directing them to a conception of Divinity neither polytheistic nor pantheistic, † neither deistic nor theistic, neither monistic nor dualistic, but a happy synthesis of all the essential features that gave these their names, into a monotheistic Unity (=Bhagavata Dharma), philosophic cum religious, intellectual cum emotional, a Unity of Godhood, in short, necessarily ethical and sufficient unto salvation. † Also in

Ramanuja may already be discovered the latest evo- lution of theistic inquiry embodied in such works, for instance, as Prof. C. Fraser's Philosophy of Theism, in which the Three Primary Data: Ego (soul); Matter, and God are elaborately considered,-which is no other than Rāmānuja's Three Postulates of Existence, the Tattva-Traya, articulately epitomised in the Yat- indra-Mata-Dipika. Ranade writes: As a matter of fact, both before Sankara-"cārya's time, and after his death, the modified (Advaita) system of Rāmānuja had played a great part in Indian Philosophy, and to it may be traced the rise and progress of Vaishnava Sects throughout India, which sects have attained to a higher and truer conception of Theism than any of the other prevailing systems'. Again he says:-'The three-fold postulates of existence (cit, acit, Išvara of Rāmānuja) are thus seen to be distinct and yet barmonized together. All attempts to assimilate and reduce them into one absolute existence fail because they are bound to fail. At the same time they are not distinct in the sense of being disjoined parts of a mechanical whole. They are one and yet they are many.' (i. e. Višishta-"dvaita).

Ramanuja later came to unify the Dravidian✶ also including the Bhagavata credo, which is par excellence 

and Christian faiths. Dravidian comprises all the Turanian branches. Aryan includes Persic, Medic, Greecian, Roman, Celtic, Teutonic, Slavonic, Christ- ian. All the three, Aryan, Semitic and Turanian thus engirdle the World. Chaldic (Assyrian) is sus- pected to be Aryan, and Judaism also, when traced through the Essenes and Ebionites. Dr. Deussen is thus justified. [see p: xv. preface.] 

(2) J. M. Kennedy in his Religions and Philosophies of the East p: 6, observes thus:-'One cannot but marvel at the impudence and conceit of the Christian missionary who goes to, say India, after a short course of training and straightway proceeds to con- fute with specially prepared arguments the doctrines of a belief devised by a much superior class of men --a belief indeed to which Christianity itself can easily be traced.' 

(3) Revd. Dr. Miller of Madras asked the British Christians to bear in mind that God was at work in India long before any missionary, Catholic or Protest- ant, set his foot there. 

*Dravidian includes the two branches Vaishnava and Šaiva. The Dramida- or Dravida-Bhashya on the Brahma-Sutras, referred to both by Sankara and Ramanuja, seems to be an ancient commentary, by its very name Dramida of Dramida-"cārya. Anterior to Ramanuja and posterior to Sankara, procrustean

concerned with the closest personality of Divinity. There is thus a Holy Trinity realised in Ramanuja, which fuses all the world-faiths into a Universal system. The Theosophical Society also, which sits en- throned in India, in Madras too, where Rámānuja's work largely lay, stript of all its occultism and esotericism-coupled with other Vedantic movements, may be taken as the most obvious evidence proving the fulfilment of Ramanuja's work. Ramanuja's work is like what Bacon wrote:-'All partitions of knowledge should be accepted, rather for lines to mark and distinguish than for sections to divide and separate, so that the continuance and entirety of knowledge be preserved.'

methods seem to have been prevalent; but Ramānuja gave true proportions by showing how the radical conceptions of God involved in such terms as Šiva, Hiranyagarbha, Indra, Agni etc., were all implicated in the comprehensive term Nārāyaṇa. See Advent IX on ' God.'

Šariraka-Paribhasha," named Yatindra-mata- Dipika (or the Light of Ramanuja's School),- which follows the Vedanta-for the instruction 

of students. 

All the sum of things are divisible into two Divisions, (1) Pramāṇa, Authority, or Measurer or Means (of knowledge), and Prameya or the Measured or Object (or Objective) (of know- jedge). 

The Means (of knowledge) is only threefold. The Object (of knowledge) is twofold, Dravya or the Thing (or Substance), and A-dravya or the Non-Thing (or Non-Substance). 

Dravya or Substance is of two kinds, Jada or the Non-sentient " and A-jada or the Sentient ". 

10 Literally: Bodied-Technology; or a technology, terminology or phraseology pertaining to the Cor- poreated. The Corporeated is the All-bodied God (Nārāyaṇa) and that treatise which discusses, or discourses on, Him, is also called the Sariraka, or the Philosophy of the Corporeated or The Philosophy and Religion of the Vedas. 

11 Non-conscient and Conscient would perhaps be more appropriate. Literally jada is inert, and a-jada is then its opposite: ert or non-inert. Non-intelligent and Intelligent: is another useful pair of terms.

YATİNDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

[Advent 

Jada or the Non-sentient is twofold, viz., Prakrti or Matter and Kala or Time. 

Prakrti or Matter is composed of twenty- four (sub-) principles (tattva). 

Kala or Time is, by reason of limitation or condition (upadhi), threefold. 

A-jada or the Sentient is twofold; Parāk or outward (objective) and Pratyak or Inward (subjective). 

Parak or Outward is also twofold: the Nitya- vibhuti or Eternal Estate, and the Dharma- bhūta-jñāna or attributive (or adjectival) con- sciousness or cognition. 

Pratyak or Inward is also twofold: Jwa or the Individual Soul and Išvara or Ruling (Universal) Soul (God). 

Java or Individual Soul is threefold: (1) Bad- dha or the Bound, (2) Mukta or the Freed, and (3) Nitya or the Eternal (or Free)." 

The Baddha or bound soul is also twofold:

The Bubhukshu or Pleasure-desirer is two- fold: the addicted to Artha" or wealth, and Kāma" or gratifications; and the devoted to Dharma" or Duties. 

The devoted to Dharma or duties are two- fold: the devoted to godlings, and the devoted to Bhagavan " (God). 

The Mumukshu or Freedom-desirer is two- fold: the addicted to Kaivalya or Isolation," and the devoted to Moksha or Salvation." 

The Moksha or Salvation-seeker is twofold: 

18 Pleasure here is meant for material enjoyments or sense-delights, either on earth or transmundane spheres such as Svarga; or what may be called the material paradise. 

14 Freedom here is meant liberation or emancipa- tion from all material associations or pleasures. It means salvation, or bliss in spiritual estate.

The Prapanna or God-resigned is twofold: the Ekūnti or the One-pointed, and the Para- mâikanti or the One-only-pointed. 

The Paramaikanti is twofold: the Drpta" or The Postulant-Patient, and the Arta" or The Postulant-Impatient. 

Išvara or God Supreme is (hypostatically) existent in five modes, viz., (1) Para or the Transcendant, (2) Vyuha or the Grouped, (3) Vibhava or the Incarnational (4) Antaryāmi or the In-Ruler, and (5) Arca or the Worship- pable."9 

Para or the Transcendant is Uniform (or the Immutable Spirit-Unit).

An examination will now be conducted in order of this specification (or enunciation) above made (of the categories). 

Of those, Pramāņa or Means of knowledge is the producer (or maker or giver) of Pramā or knowledge. Means' is what is to be defined; the definition of it is that it is the producer of Pramā, knowledge'. Pramā is jñāna or 'knowledge consonant with experience in its exactitude'. Prama or knowledge is the thing to be defined. The definition is that which

has the quality of knowledge consonant with experience in its exactitude'. Supposing the definition of Prama was simply knowledge', the knowledge which sees silver in a pearl-oyster would be a definition overlapping its bounds (ati-vyāpti), (or over-pervading its legitimate limits). Hence the definition of Pramā takes the form: 'knowledge consonant with experience'. Even then the fault of over-pervasion (ati-vyāpti) remains, inasmuch as one in a moment of illusion (or delusion) may mistake the pearl-oyster for silver. Hence (the further) qualificatory clause to the definition: in its exactitude (yathâvas- thita)'. By this expression, samsaya, anya- of Sesha or the Serpent.

Ati-vyapti is one of the three faults to which a definition is exposed. The fault ati-vyapti or Inclusion would include things beyond the scope of the defini- tion. The other fault is a-vyapti or Exclusion of things which ought to fall within the definition intended. The third fault is a-samblava, or Non-existence, or Negation, example: the definition of a sky-flower. See infra P.9. 

"Naturalness, or Naturality would be apt. Another expression which may be employed is reality, or actuality. The whole definition may stand thus as an alternative: 'Knowledge exact to,

thā-jñāna and viparīta-jñāna are avoided (which would) otherwise vitiate the definition. 

Samsaya or Doubt is the apperception of mutually contradicting attributes in a thing (dharmi) to be apprehended. For example, the doubt whether a long-looking or erect object is post or person. 

Anyathā-jšāna or Wrong Apprehension is the mistaken apperception of one attribute for another. For example, the proposition which ascribes the agency in the real agent, soul, as due to illusion. (This is dharma-viparyāsa). 

Viparita-jñāna or Reversed Apprehension is the mistaken apperception of one thing itself for another. (For example the mistaking of the post itself for the person). (This is dharmi- viparyāsa). 

A definition (or sign of a thing) has three faults, (1) a-vyāpti, (2) ati-vyāpti and (3) a-sam- bhava". A-vyāpti or non-pervasion is the non- existence of the sign" (or definition) in the thing signified" (or to be defined). Ati-vyāpti

or over-pervasion is the existence of the sign (or definition) in things other than the things to be signified. A-sambhava is the non-existence of the sign (or definition) anywhere. For example the statement (or assertion) that Jiva or the Individual Soul is an object of perception by the eye. 

As therefore these faults are absent in the definition given of Pramana or Means of know- ledge, that definition is well established. 

= 

(Now in the proposition, Pramā-karaṇa Pramāṇa, i.e., the producer of knowledge, is the Means of knowledge, what is meant by Karana, producer, maker or effecter ?). Karaṇa or producer is that which is the best instrument (by which knowledge is obtained). The best instrument is the instrument than which there is none better. Hence it is evident that Pramāṇa or the Means of Knowledge is that instrument than which there is none better by which to obtain (that) knowledge. 

There is a definition of Pramana as that which makes known what is unknown. But those who propose this definition have them- selves refuted it. Hence it is not acceptable.

The Pramānas or the Means of knowledge are three :-(1) Pratyaksha or Perception, " Anumāna or Inference, and Šabda or Word. 

Of these, Perception is the Means which renders knowledge actually sensible (or made manifest to the senses). 'Manifest to the sen- ses' is (a necessary clause) to show its variety from Inference. Pramü or knowledge is to show its character different from what it would be to the vitiated (unsound, defective or diseased) sense. 

This Perception is twofold: Sa-vikalpaka or collective, and Nir-vikalpaka or general. " Nir-vikalpaka or general, is superficial Know- ledge of a thing consisting in its attributes, form etc., obtained at first sight. Sa-vikalpaka, general or particular, is thorough Knowledge of a thing consisting in its attributes, form etc., obtained on deep reflexion (or meditation).

[Advent 

In both cases, attributes, form etc., are an- cillary sine qua non; for if these ancillaries (or auxiliaries) were absent, the knowledge (of a thing) is neither present" nor known. " 

** 

The process of perception is thus: (1) the soul's" contact with the mind, (2) the mind " with the sense, and (3) the sense" with the object." 

The invariable function of the senses is to illuminate the object to be perceived. (For example), the contiguity of the sense, eye etc., with the object, pot etc., causes the ocular knowledge: "This is the pot ". Thus also are the tactual and other perceptions. In the per- ception of a thing, contact is the connexion. In the perception of the form etc., of a thing, (the relation or connection called) Samavāya or An-upalambha is the scientific term. It means that a thing devoid of attributes, form etc., is beyond recognition or perception.

The perceptions Nir-vikalpaka (or general) and Sa-vikalpaka (particular)" are twofold: Arvacina or memorial" (lit. recent) and An- arvăcina or non-memorial "(= ancient or primal lit. remote). The memorial again is twofold: sense-helped and sense-unhelped. 

The sense-unhelped is twofold: Svayam- siddha or self-ascertained, and Divya or divine. Self-ascertained is what is engendered by Yoga or deep meditation. Divine is what is caused by Bhagavan's (God's) Grace.

This non-memorial (perception) is passingly re- ferred to. 

Thus Pratyaksha or Sense-Perception is that which generates Sakshātkāra, or knowledge, sense-evident. 

But an objection may be put forward thus:- Prama or knowledge has been defined to be knowledge as is actually consonant (or consistent) with experience. This condition is also found present in Smrti or memory; hence memory or recollection must also be counted as a Means of knowledge. How then are such Means (pra- māņas) stated to be only Three?**" 

To this objection it is said: Even if memory be admited as a Means,it is dependent on Sams- kara," or residua left of previous experiences, and these residua are dependent on (sense-) perception. Hence memory is included (or

involved) in perception, and there is no need to constitute it into a distinct Means or Authority. 

Hence the Means (or Authorities or Instru- ments of knowledge) become determined as Three (only.) 

Memory or Recollection is Knowledge derived from the residua or impressions left of a pre- vious (or past) experience. The excitants (that rouse the dormant residua into remembrance) 

are as per verse: 

Sadrsa'dṛshfa-cinta'dyaiḥ 

Smṛti-bijasya bādhakāḥ. 

48 

Sometimes the excitant is the sight of some- thing similar (previously sensed); sometimes an unseen (or unexpected) fate (adṛshfa); some- times deep musing. Similarity is thus (exempli- fied): (1) If two (individuals) Devadatta and Yajñadatta had once been seen together, the sight of Devadatta excites the remembrance of Yajñadatta. (2) The second is the unexpected (i. e., unconscious cerebration) leaping into

What is well experienced engenders constant remem- brance. Forgetfulness is caused by much time elapsing (after the prior experience) or by sickness etc., which weaken the residua (Sams- kāras). "1

recollection (Pratyabhijna) also is included therein such as: this Devadatta is that'.

The reflexion of one's face in the mirror etc., is also of a fact; for the eye-rays are intercepted by the mirror, and the eye sees along with the mirror etc.," its own face etc., Even in this case the process is so rapid as to prevent the per- ception of all that may intervene between (the eye and the mirror). 

In such cases as the cognition of a double moon (instead of one) it is caused through the pressure of the finger (on the eye), or owing to eye-affections (timira) etc., when the visual rays stream in different directions.

Now, Anumana or Inference will be ex- pounded: 

That knowledge (Pramiti) is Inferential knowledge (Anumiti), which is the particular knowledge of the pervading (Vyāpaka), obtained from the consideration of the pervaded- ness of the pervaded (Vyāpaka) ". The Instrument or Means by which such knowledge is obtained is Inference (Anumāna). (Illustra- tion): Knowing that smoke is pervaded by fire, the knowledge of the pervading is obtained, ie., fire. 

The Pervaded (Vyāpya) is ruled by limit- edness of space and time. The Pervading (Vyapaka) has the Characteristic (vṛtti) of 

Vyapya and Vyapaka are technical terms of Hindu Noëtics. In the sentence. 'smoke is pervaded by fire', it means that the one is invariably found with the other. Vyapti would be the invariable or universal concomitance of two things; or the insepa- rable connection of the one with the other, sine In the illustration, smoke is the Pervaded,

[Advent 

The Pervaded 

is even in inseparable conjunction (with the Pervading). The Pervading is the correlate (or Co-ordinate to the Pervaded). The invariable fixed relation subsisting between the two is Pervasion (Vyapti). This Pervasion, stated as: 'Where there is smoke, there is fire' is admitted, from frequent (or repeated) observation. ** 

Pervasion is twofold: Positive (Anvaya) and Negative (Vyatireka). Where by an Inferrant (Sadhana) the Inferred (Sadhya) is attempted, that Pervasion is called Positive, for example: 'Whatever is smoky is fiery'", where, by the denial of the Inferred (Sadhya), the denial of fire the Pervading, element. Vyapti may perhaps be rendered by co-concurrence of two or more facts. 

"This means that fire is a more universal term than smoke, for there may be fire where there is no smoke, but where there is smoke there is fire. Cp. this with the major term and middle term of logic, the minor term being the place where fire is found (say mountain). Vyapya is thus the Particular, and Vyapaka the Universal.

the Inferrant (Sādhana) is attempted, that Per- vasion (Vyapti) is Negative, for example: 'What is non-fiery is non-smoky '. " Both these kinds of Pervasion is affected or circumscribed by conditions (Upadhi). Condition (Upadhi) means where the Inferred (Sadhya) pervades, the In- ferrant (Sadhana) does not pervade. For example, where, by fire, smoke is intended to be inferred, the condition (required) is conjunction with moist firewood; or where brownness is intended to be inferred by being the son (or sonness) of Maitri, the condition is the circum- stance of such birth (caused) by (eating) cooked

Condition or Limitation (Upādhi) is twofold: Settled (Nišcita) and Doubted (Šankita).

In this (syllogism), the condition Upādhi) (of serving a king, which is distasteful to the servitor) is provided by (one's) sin being the determinant. But this does not exist in the ser- vice to God. This therefore is called the Settled 

condition.88 

The Doubted is thus:- 

(Assertion) The disputed 8 soul, after the term of this body, attains Release (Mukti) (=Conclusion). 

such a fact may suggest the cause to be due to his eating of green vegetables. The inference of a cause from an effect is thus affected by some condition. 

** That is, that soul is to serve God is a condition of a settled nature.. 

"Disputed means a disputed point,-a questioned assertion. That is, God-service may, or not, be a fact. Such an entity as soul may, or not, exist. A noot-point.

33 

In this (syllogism), the condition (required) is the surceasal of all actions or works (Karma). As it is doubtful whether such a condition exists or no in a problematical soul,-meditation- ripe-that condition is called the doubted. 

Hence, where a connection (or relation) exists unaffected by condition (Nir-upādhika), that which is so connected is the Pervaded (Vya- pya). 

Pervaded (Vyapya), Means or Instrument (Sādhana), Sign (Linga), are not of different import". "This has two forms, which are limbs (i.e., factors or elements) to Inferential know- ledge (Anumiti):-(1) Pervasion (Vyapti), and

Sa-paksha (Right Subject or Place) is the similarity to that where an attribute is to be established; such as the kitchen-hearth etc. 

Vi-paksha (Wrong Subject or Place) is the dissimilarity to where an attribute is to be esta- blished; such as the lake etc. 

Badhita-vishayatva (annulled thing) is the absence of what is to be surely established in the subject by strong reasons (to the contrary); such as: 'the lake is fiery'. 'Not so annulled' is A-badhita-vishayatva. 

A-sat-pratipakshatva" is the non-annulment by an equally strong reason.

The aforesaid Anumāna (Inference), say some, is divisible into two kinds: (1) Svārtha or Self- benefit, (2) Parartha or Others' benefit. Others (opine): it is of the 'self' character alone, inasmuch as all inferences are ensuant on the power of one's own reflection, and hence useful for one's own procedure.

similar to that associated with cow. Then arises the knowledge of the form (or the new object, the Cow-like Gavaya), so associated, aided by the remembrance of the meaning of the sentence (before heard). Assortable thus with remem- brance (memory), Comparison is classable under Perception. Or it is classable under Inference as there is evidence of a process of induction (Vyapti)." Or it may be surmised as falling under the class 'Word', for it is derived from a sentence (heard). 

111 

Arthâpatti or Assumption is thus:- A person is observed not eating in the day time, yet looks plump. The assumption is made that he eats in the night. This is classifiable under Inference 

Tarka or argument is the bringing about a non-desire (or negation) of the Pervading (Vyā- paka) by admitting the Pervaded (Vyapya), thus:-Supposing an Inference were stated:

THE WORD

At the outset of a Creation, God (Bhaga- vān,) 1" evolved out of His Consciousness what 

195 

past order of the Vedas had there lain, and taught them to Catur-mukha.. When this is granted, eternality and non-human-ness are assured. Then are absent the errors of sense 

and contrarieties. 

But it may be asked how the Vedas can be authoritative (Prāmāṇyam), inasmuch as the Mimāmsakas"" admit them only as concerned with Karya or Effects, and that Texts concern- ing the Self-evident (Siddha) Brahman (God), 

150 Personal God. See J. R. A. S. for July 1910 for a discussion of the term Bhagavān,

17 The School of the Vedas who contend that work is Deity, and work done generates Effects, or whatever Fruits are desired by mankind. Hence these are said to belong to the Effects' faction. Per contra are the Vedantins who posit Brahman or God as the Effective or ready, or what is Self- Evident (Siddha), and that Holy Vedic Texts need not necessarily be with reference to 'Effects' but they as well educate or instruct mankind as to God, a self-evident fact, or a fact not 'effectible' or 'creat- able' as the Mimāṁsakas would contend.

do not convey instruction. This (objection) is met by showing that (1) these Texts which are concerned with the Self-evident Brahman are employable for purposes of contemplation (Upasana), partaking of the nature of effects (Kārya); (2) that even sentences employed in wordly affairs, such as: 'Thy father is doing well,' do convey instruction (or sense); and (3) that in the world it is seen that children, gradually and repeatedly taught by their mothers, fathers etc., by employing words connoting mother, father, uncle, moon etc., (at same time) indicating these with their fingers, come to understand the meanings thereof: Hence, in the (case of the) Vedas also, words convey instruction (or know- ledge) of things self-evident. Hence there is no room for questioning the authoritativeness of the Vedas. 

(Also) it need not be doubted how that part (of the Vedas) which treats of Abhicara etc.,"" can be authoritative, for by their means visible

Hence in their totality are the Vedas authori- tative. 

This Veda is twofold: (1) the Pre-Division (Purva) treating of Works (Karma), (2) the Post- Division (Uttara) treating of God (Brahman). 

The Pre-Division treats of Works, which is Worship (of God); and the Post-Division treats of Brahman (God), the Worshippable. Hence both the mimämsas, or Vedic Discourses consti- tute one Science (Šāstra).

Mantra explains the Purpose (artha) of action, (or shows the motive for act). 

Arthavada constitutes passages intended to stimulate effort conformable to Injunctions (Vidhi). 

Vidhi is 'text' which enjoins what is good (for one to do). Vidhi (Injunction) is again threefold:- 

(1) Apūrva, (2) Parisankhyā and (3) Niyama. Again is it divisible into many classes; such as: Nitya, Naimittika, Kāmya &c.

Kalpa is the exposition of the modus operandi of Šrauta1 and Smarta's ritual. Šikshā is what concerns itself with the syntactical collocation of letters (Phonetics). 

Nirukta is what concerns itself with the ex- planation of rare meanings (of words) (Etymo- logical lexicography). 

Jyotisha is what determines the time for undertaking Adhyayana and its precepts (Astronomy and Astrology). 

Vyakarana is known to be that which deter- mines the pure word-formation and intonation (Grammar).

181 

C 

Mukhya-vytti or Primary force is the Abhidhū- vṛtti" or denotative power, for example (the word) 'Lion', denoting (or meaning) the King of the Forest' (only). The Primary power (of words) is further resolvable into many varieties such as: Yoga or Radical (or etymological), Rudha or Conventional, and Yoga-rudha or Radical-Conventional,* etc. 

Where the Primary force is affected, the next nearest sense becomes the metaphorical (Upacāra). 

and 'neighs after a long interval, it would be want- ing in that Proximity which would convey the sense: 'Horse neighs.' [See Tarka-Samgraha, Dipikā &c].

The Metaphorical is again divisible into: (1) Lakshaṇā or Indirect and (2) Gauna or Secondary. The First (Lakshaṇā) is thus: 'A hamlet in the Ganga' means a hamlet on its bank, as, for a hamlet directly located (in the river itself of Ganga) is a violation (of sense); hence indirectly the bank (of Gangā) is meant. The second (Gauna) is thus:-'A lion is Deva- datta', is to indicate that Devadatta is endowed with strength etc., (like the lion). 

Thus all utterances, Vedic and of the world, have reference to objects with attributes, and import duality.""" 

As in the manner that terms denoting 'body' have their final connotation for the 'embodied,' 153 

16 The author here alludes to the Advaitic or monistic doctrine which disproves duality or all dis- tinctions or differences actually discernible in Nature. 

188 I. e., the Possessor of the body, or the living spirit or soul in the body. When I say 'I', pointing to my body, the term 'I' means eventually the soul in the body. By parity of reasoning, all terms which denote the Kosmos refer finally to the Substrate or Noumenon which sustains it, without which Kosmos can have no existence. Hence Kosmos is ' 

'Body' to God, and God is therefore the Embodied'.

MATTER (Prakṛti.) 

After the treatment of Pramāņa (or Means of knowledge) Prameya "" or Object of knowledge will be treated. Prameya (literally) means what is well (pra), measured (meya). 

It (Object) is twofold: Dravya or Substance, and A-dravya or Non-Substance. Substance is the Upādāna or Substrate, Base or Receptacle; and the Receptacle is the Abode of States or Modes (Avasthâ-"šraya). 

How, it may be asked, is this twofold division: Substance and Non-Substance to be maintained, when other schools enumerate a six-fold divi- sion:-Dravya or Substance, Guna or Quality, Karma or action, Sāmānya or Genus etc ?1

We reply: 

OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE 

63 

To consider Karma or Action (for example), as comprised of Ut-kshepana or Throwing up, Apa-kshepana or Throwing down, Akuñcana or Contraction, Prasarana or Expansion, and Gamana or Movement," is cumbrous, for it is reducible to the simple proposition: Action (or Energy) is what is inherent with motion.' And this may be shown as caused by conjunction (Samyoga). 1BB 

188 

As to Sāmānya, Genus or Generality, such (a category) is redundant by the fact that the form (of any substance) is itself the class (Jāti). 

One Samavāya or Inhesion (or Co-inherence), admitted in another Inhesion, leads to infinite regress. Hence it is resolvable into conjunction (or quality of two things conjoined)." 

189 

It is also cumbrous to admit (another Category): Višesha or Particularity, in order to Samavaya or Inhesion and Abhava or Non-existence. With the last the number becomes seven; et seq.

[Advent 

account for such differences of attributes as those of Atomicity (Anutva) and Infinitude (Vibhutva), characterising (respectively) Soul (Jiva) and God (Išvara). 

Hence, as distinct (Categories), Action (Karma), Generality (Sāmānya), Particularity (Višesha) and Inhesion (Samavāya) are not admitted, the twofold Division: Substance (Dravya), and Non-Substance (A-dravya), answers well. 

By this, it is also refuted that Abhava (Non- existence) is a seventh Category; for Non-exis- tence always implies its correlative, Existence (Bhāva). 

Prag-abhava or antecedent Non-existence is previous condition; Dhvamsa or (post- cedent) destruction is the after-condition. Atyanta-"bhāva or Absolute Non-existence, and Anyonya-"bhāva or Mutual Non-existence, (simply) refer to particular features in a Sub- stance (Dharmi). Hence the inclusion of this (category, viz., Abhāva) under (Pratyaksha . or) Perception. 

It was said that Dravya (Substance) is the Upādāna (or Abode of States: Avasthâ-"šraya). 

[IV 

OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE: MATTER 

65 

The general definition also holds good that Substance is the Abode of Attributes (Gunâ- "š-raya). 

The Substances (then) are Six:-(1) Prakṛti or Matter, (2) Kāla or Time, (3) Šudda-satva or Pure Matter, (4) Dharmabhūta-Jñāna or attributive consciousness, (5) Jiva or Soul, and (6) Išvara or God.100 

These (Six Substances) are divisible into two classes, Jada or Inert, and A-jaḍa or non-inert (ie., Self-luminous). 

The nature of the 'Inert' is described as that 

which is devoid of Non-mixed Matter.161 And 

16° Of these (1) and (2) may be called Objective Substance; and (5) and (6) Subjective Substance, (3) and (4) linking the two sets. (3) may be called Subjective Matter, (1) being called Objective Matter; and (4) may be called Conscious Substance. Science has made a distinction between Ponderable matter and Imponder- able matter; but the latter is still Objective. Hence (3) Šuddha-Satva, a matter which is of the celestial or heavenly order, is thus best conceivable by the ex- pression Subjective-matter. 

16 1 

Objective Matter is Mixed Matter; Pure Matter is Subjective Matter. That which is not the latter is the former which is Inert or that which is not Self- luminous.

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

[Advent 

this is of two kinds: Prakṛti or (objective) Matter, and Kala or Time. 

169 

Prakṛti or (Objective or Mixed) Matter is the Abode of the Three Gunas or Properties viz., Satva (Light), Rajas (Motive) and Tamas (Dark). It is Nitya or Eternal, called by such names as Akshara or the Imperishable, Avidya or the Nescient, Maya or the Illusory 

etc. 

By reason of oddness produced in it (Matter) by the will of God (Bhagavan), it acquires a kinetic (Kāry-onmukha) state, which is called Avyakta or Indiscreet. From this, Mahān or 'Great' is produced. Mahan is in a threefold state, characterised by Satva, Rajas and Tamas. From Mahat, Ahamkara or the 'Individualising' is generated. This also is in three divisions: Satvikâ'hamkāra, Rājasâ'- hamkāra and Tāmasâ'hâṁkāra. These are otherwise also named as Vaikarika, Taijasa and Bhutādi (respectively). Being known as Vai- kārika or the Modifying, the Sātvikâ'haṁkāra

aided bythe Taijasa, named Rājasâ'haṁkāra, engenders the Eleven Indriyas or Senses. 

The definition of Sense is that which has for its material basis the Satvikâ'haṁkāra. The Sense is twofold, the Jñān-endriya or Know- ledge-sense, and Karm-endriya or Action-sense. The Knowledge-sense is that by which know- ledge is transmitted. It is sixfold: (1) Manas or mind, (2) hearing, (3) seeing, (4) smelling (5) tast- ing and (6) touch. The mind is that which causes memory (smrti) etc. This resides in the region of the heart. It is variously called by the terms Buddhi or Intelligence, Ahamkara or the I-making', Citta or Recollection etc. And it is the Cause of Bondage (Bandha) and Deliverance (Moksha) ""*. 

168 Manas is the organ through which soul's con- sciousness flows to the Senses, and thus performs the efferent function, and again is it the Sense Commune, to which all the afferent sensations gathered by the avenues of the Ten Senses, those of Know- ledge as well as those of Action, converge, and percepts, there formed into concepts, are delivered finally to the Soul. In Western Psychology, Mind includes soul and is the Principle of conscious- ness, whereas in Eastern Psychology, soul alone is

Of the (other) Five: hearing etc., that which has the power of apprehending sound only, is the Sense of Hearing, which resides in the cavity of the Ear-the Eye in the case of serpents etc. That which has the power of apprehending color only, is the Sense of Seeing which resides in the Eye. That which has the power of apprehending Odour only, is the Sense of Smelling which re- sides in the nasal extremity-the trunk in the elephant etc. That which has the power of apprehending Savour only, is the Sense of Tast- ing which resides at the tip of the tongue. That which has the power of apprehending Touch only, is the Sense of Touch which resides all over the body. Touch, not (keenly) felt in nails, teeth, hair &c., is accounted for by degrees of the low vitality of those places. The description of 

the Principle of Consciousness, rather the Abode of Consciousness; and mind is a material sense, internal, the external being the other ten senses: seeing etc. 

The Division of this mind into Buddhi etc., bas only partial correspondence with the Western Divi- sion of Intellect, Will and Feelings. The mind residing in the heart has a bearing on the Feelings connected with this same organ.

the Senses of Hearing etc., as Elemental (Bhau- tika) is figurative by virtue of the Elements affording them gratification. Of these (senses) some function by (mediate) association, and some by (immediate) contact with objects. So avers old tradition. 

י, 

The facility to act-any one out of them such as speaking etc.,-characterises generally the Karm-endriya or Action-Sense. This (Action- Sense) is established in a fivefold manner: Speaking, Grasping, Moving, Evacuating and Generating. That which enables articulation of letters is the Sense of Speaking. This abides in eight places, viz., heart, throat, tip of tongue, palate, teeth, lip, nose and head. In the case of mutes etc., the defect of Destiny (or merit) accounts for its absence. That which enables manual work is the Sense of Grasping. This resides at the finger-tips of the human etc., species. That which enables to move is the Sense of Moving. This resides in the feet of human and other species. In the case of ser- pents and birds etc., it resides in the breast, wings etc. That which enables evacuation etc., 

70 

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

[Advent 

is the Sense of Evacuation. This resides in the several organs (Payu) set apart (for the purpose). That which causes a specific joy is the Sense of Generation. This resides in the organ of generation (Upastha)* etc. These Senses are minute. These accompany the Soul (Java) in its migrations to other bodies and other worlds etc. In the state of emancipation (mukti), they cannot accompany to the im- material regions; hence their abidance here till the Period of Dissolution; or they are reappro- priated by others who stand in need of them. That the Senses of Action perish with the death of the body is an opinion contrary to Bhashya etc. Hence inadmissible. The opposite schools are also controverted, therefore, which maintain a male sense, a female sense, a single sense: the sense of Touch only etc.

OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE: MATTER 71 

From the Tamasâ'haṁkāra, called Bhūtādi fostered by Rajasâ'haṁkāra, spring the five Subtle Elements (Tanmātras), Sound etc, and the Five Elements (Bhutas), Ether etc. The Subtle Elements are the Subtle Substances im- mediately connected with the (gross) Elements; and they are the base (of the latter). Elements are the Substrata in which the objective Sound etc, inhere. The Subtle Elements are five :- 

(1) Sound-Subtle Element, (2) Touch-Subtle Element, (3) Colour-Subtle Element, (4) Savour- Subtle Element, (5) Odour-Subtle Element. The Elements are also five:-(1) Ether, (2) Air, (3) Fire, (4) Water, (5) Earth. 

The Sound-Subtle Element is the compound substance intervenient to Tamasā'haṁkāra and Ether (Ākāša), like the modification between milk and curds. From this (Subtle Element) springs Ether. The properties of Ether are defined in such terms as :- 

(1) Imperceptible to touch, is the Substrate for the quality Sound, 

(2) Affording gratification to the Organ of bearing (Ear),72 

YATİNDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

(3) Affording room (extension). 

[Advent 

It (Ether) is characterised by Sound only. It is perceptible according to the familiar saying: 'Sky is blue'. It has color and parts by reason of the Quintuplicative Process (Pañci- karaṇa-Prakriya). By this (reasoning), the opinion that Ether is non-generate is disproved 

A distinct (Category such as) Direction (Dik) needs no creation, inasmuch as such Direction as East etc, is derivable from the associations of the motions of the sun with the sky (Akaša). The creation of Direction is to be understood like the creation of Sky etc. 

From Ether springs the Touch-Subtle Ele- ment. This Touch-Subtle Element is the com- pound Substance occupying the intermediate state between Ether and Air. From it Air springs. The properties of Air are defined in such terms as:- 

(1) Perceptible everywhere to touch, absent of color, 

(2) The Substance perceptible to the Sense of Touch as we possess it, 

IV.] OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE: MATTER 

73 

(3) Neither warm nor cold to touch, absent of color. This Air is diverse. It receives the designation of cold, warm, fragrant etc, by vir- tue of its (Air's) contact with water, heat, flower etc., (respectively). It is helpful to the Sense of Touch by its rendering it gratification. Its characteristics are Sound and Touch. And in its function of supporting the body, it is called Prāṇa or Life (Vital Air). 

This (Prana or Life) is fivefold: (1) Prāṇa (2) Apāna, (3) Vyāna, (4) Udāna and (5) Samāna. Prāņa (resides) in the heart, Apāna in the anus, Vyana pervades the body, Udāna (is) in the throat, and Samana in the regions of the navel. This law holds in the case of the Movables (Jangama). In the case of the Im- movables (Sthavara), the Life-association is slender. The contention that air is proved by Inference is confuted by the fact that it is per- ceptible to Touch. 

The Color-Subtle-Element is the compounded substance intervenient to Air and Fire. From 

that springs Fire. 

10 

74 

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

The definition of Fire is :- 

(1) Warmth to touch, (2) Lustrous coloredness. 

[Advent 

It causes outside, maturing etc., by means of Fire and Sun, and inside, as fire in the stomach, is designated as Vaišvānara: Except in the case of owls etc., all ocular knowlege is aided by means of light. This (Fire-Element) is fourfold: (1) Bhauma, (2) Divya, (3) Audarya, (4) Ākar- aja. That which is in the earthy fuel is Bhauma (terrestrial)—the flame etc. That which is of water only is Divya (celestial)-the Sun etc. That which is in earth and water combined is Audarya (bodily),-the stomach-fire etc. Fuel- less fire is Akaraja (mineral)-gold etc. The absence of warmth in the touch of gold (etc.,) is due to its association with other substances. 

There is also a general classification as (1) Effulgence (Prabka) and the Effulgent (Prabhāvān). Effulgence is a Fire-species which is subject to contraction or expansion of radiance caused by the presence or absence of 

* Etc., includes lightning and such other fiery Elements potentially abidant in the Water-Element. 

IV.] OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE: MATTER 

75 

environment (respectively). This Effulgence is connate with the Effulgent, and disappears with its disappearance. It is of the substance, as also of the quality and made up of parts. Hence the contention for its purely qualitative character, is refuted. Characterised by Efful- gence is the Effulgent. That this (Fire-Element) is fourfold has already been explained. It is possessed of the qualities of Sound, Touch and Color. 

The Savour-Subtle-Element is the compound- ed Substance intervenient to Fire and Water. From that springs Water. Its definition is given in such terms as :— 

(1) Coldness to touch, 

(2) Odourless and Savourful. 

Its nature being white, sweet and cold, the differences of Color, Savour, and Touch are adventitious qualities ensuant on contact with extrinsic circumstances. 

This (Water) is manifold as of the ocean, the river etc. It is characterised by Sound, Touch, Color and Savour. By it, is sprinkling, lumping etc., (done). 

76 

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

[Advent 

The Odour-Subtle-Element is the compound- ed Substance which is intervenient to Water and Earth. Form it springs Earth. Its defini- tion is given in such terms as:- 

(1) All-odorous, 

(2) Odorous, and neither warm nor cold to touch. 

It is redolent, sweet, dark-coloured, and neither warm nor cold to touch. Its modifica- tions bring about all kinds of Color, Odour and Savour. Its use is displayed by its affording gratification to mind and nose. Its modifications assume the character of mud, stone, food, herbs etc. It is characterised by the qualities: Sound Touch, Color, Savour and Odour. It is the means of support. Darkness is included in Earth, for it is its quality, or a particular state of it. Hence the opinion that it is merely the absence of light and not a substance etc., is re- butted. 

Consequent on the Quintuplicative Process (Pañci-karana-prakriya), all the qualities (Sound etc.,) are to be found in all the Elements. God (Bhagavan) creates the Elements by the 

IV.] OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE: MATTER 

77 

Quintuplicative Process, divides each Element into two portions, and reserving one portion, divides the other portion into four parts. He distributes these four parts, one for each of the other four Elements. When this is done with regard to all the (Five) Elements, each Element retains its own moiety, the other moiety being compounded of the parts of the other Elements. By reason of its own component (moiety) being greater, and of the other components being smaller, it is designated by the terms: Earth etc. The teaching of the Triplicatory Process in the Vedas means by implication the Quintuplicatory Process. Others posit a Septuplicatory Process by combining the Elements with (the principles) Mahat and Ahaṁkāra. 

Of these (Principles of Matter), twenty four in number, the five Elements, Prakṛti (Primal Matter), Mahat and Ahaṁkāra, organise the Body (Šarira). The Eleven Senses, enumerated separately-a set for each Soul (Purusha)- possess each body, like gems set in a jewel. One definition of Body is thus-wise given :— 

It is a Substance in indiscerptible relation with the Soul, to which it is bound as the 

78 

YATÎNDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

[Advent 

Sustained (Adheya), Ordained (Vidheya) and Disposed (Sesha). Each of these: 'Sustained," 'Ordained' and 'Disposed' may be considered also as a threefold distinctive definition. A neutral (tajastha) definition is that it is a Substance distinct from God (Išvara) and His knowledge (Jnana). Hence, the definitions attempted by others are discarded, such as:- 

(1) The abode of action' is Body, (2) The 'abode of Senses' is Body, (3) The 'house of enjoyment' is Body, 

(4) The 'aggregate of the limbs: head, hands, feet etc.,' is Body; etc. 

The Body is twofold: Eternal and Non- Eternal. The Eternal is the Body of God (Išvara) the pure Abode etc., of the Three- Propertied Substance, Time and Soul; and the natural Body assuming the shapes of the kite, 1or 

snake 18 etc: of the Eternal-celestials (Nitya-Suris)." The Non-Eternal is twofold:

Non-Karma"""-made and Karma-made (Karma- kṛta). The First constitutes the forms of God 11 (Išvara), Mahat etc., and likewise forms assumed at will by Ananta, Garuda Etc., (Archangels), the Freed (Mukta)" and God. The Karma- made (body) is also twofold ; (1) will-prompted Karma-made, and (2) exclusively Karma-made. The former is as in the case of great souls like Saubhari." For others, the other. Again there is a twofold general classification: (1) Immov- able and (2) Movable. The Immovable are the rocks, trees, shrubs etc. The Movable is fourfold:-(1) Celestial (Deva), (2) Human (Manushya), (3) Animal (Tiryak) and (4) Hellish (Nāraki). A division also is based upon the modes of birth: (1) seed-born, (2) sweat-born, (3) egg-born (oviparous) and (4) womb-born 

170 Karma is the sum of acts generated by the soul, and constitutes the cause for embodied existence; and this Karma is spread over many such lives till enfranchisement (Moksha) is achieved.

Thus the Egg"" is generated by the Quintupli- cative Process. The creation prior to that of the Egg is the General (Samashți) Creation, and after it is the Special (Vyashti) creation. Creation or birth, of Mahat etc., means a change of state simply, as may be illustrated by the palm-leaf changing into the ear-ring"", or as (is evident) in such expression as: army, forest " etc. The distinctions made in practice between Cause and Effect is consequent on a particular relation which holds between an antecedent and a postcedent state.

In this manner, the Twenty-four Categorical Divisions (of Prakṛti) consisting of Primal Matter, Mahat, Ahaṁkāra, the Eleven Senses, the Five Subtle Elements and the Five (Gross) Elements, have been described.

The Primordial Matter etc., constitute the Ob- jects (Bhogya), Instruments (Bhog-ópakarana) and the Habitat (Bhoga-sthana) of enjoyment for both God (Išvara) and Soul (Jiva). The Objects are the group of things, of sound etc.

The Instruments are those of the Eye etc. The Habitat consists of the Egg (Brahmāṇḍa)*, composed of the Fourteen Spheres. The Egg is likened to a wood-apple, a result of the Quintuplicated Elements and of Prarabdha (or the sum of the Karmic forces set agoing by the countless souls whose destiny is linked with this particular Egg or System of world-process).

Measured thus by the Devas' standard, twelve thousand years is called the Four Yugas. Four thousand of these consti- tutes Krta-Yuga, when Virtue (Dharma) is of its full measure. Three thousand of them with three parts of Virtue constitutes the Treta- Yuga. Two thousand with two parts of Vir- tue constitutes the Dvapara. One thousand with one part of Virtue is the Kali-Yuga.

Non-inertness means Self-luminousness (Sva- yam-prakāšatva). Self-luminousness cum exte- riority (Paraktva), characterises both Pure Matter and Attributive Consciousness.

Texts, which declare that the Freed (Mukta- soul) has no body, signify the negation of Karma-determined body. The senses (in this body) being eternal, the law of Cause and Effect does not prevail. Hence like the material (series), it needs no distinct categorising. The school therefore which upholds a bodiless condit- ion there (i.e., in the state of Mukti, or Freedom Spiritual) is thus rejected. Likewise the faction, which contends that it (the Eternal Universe, Nitya-vibhuti) is a portion of Matter, is also dismissed as it is in contravention of the passage: Beyond Darkness-that it is dis- tinct from (Ākāša) is proved by its properties of Sound, Touch, Colour, Savour and Odour, being of immaterial nature. That it is inert is

ATTRIBUTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS. 

(Dharma-bhūta-jñāna).

Consecutively, (the topic of) Attributive Consciousness will now be expounded. The nature of it is described thus:- 

1. While it is self-luminous, non-sentient sub- stance, it is 'objectivated' (sa-vishayatvam) (ie., some object always constituting its content); 

2. While it is pervasive (Vibhu), it is of the nature of substance (Dravya), and attribute (Guna) like light; 

3. It is the illuminant of objects; 

4. It is Intellect or Intelligence (Buddhi) etc. Attributive Consciousness" is, to God and the Eternals (Nityas), ever eternal and pervasive (or diffusive); to the Bound (Baddha-souls) it

is obstructed. To the Freed (Mukta-souls), it was before obstructed but now risen. 

But it may be asked how, if Consciousness is eternal, the parlance such as: 'Consciousness is (now) born, Consciousness (now) lost' is to be accounted for? The answer is that such is in vogue by reason of Consciousness being suscep- tible of contraction and expansion. Like water issuing out of the hole of a leather-bag, Consciousness streams through the avenues of the senses, and contacts objects. Contraction and Expansion are like the serpent and its coiling up. All Consciousness is essentially self-evident (or self-authoritative), and is self- luminous. The hypothetical"" Consciousness is the means (or instrument) at one's disposal for all functions concerned with it, for such a function is made possible by it without seeking the aid of another thing sui generis, like object (Artha), sense (Indriya), Light (Dipa), etc."*

* Like light not requiring the aid of another light to be seen one object another object; and sense, another sense.

By this (delineation given of Consciousness), the opinions, that (1) Consciousness is instan- taneous, (2) it is endurant for three (successive or continuous) instants, (3) its illusory nature even in matters-of-fact (Vyāvahārika) transact- ions, as it is in matters phantasmal (Prāt- bhāsika),* (4) its nature demonstrable by other proof (i.e., not self-evident), (5) its being the Soul itself, etc., are discarded.

'Granting that on the strength of Scriptures (Agama), Consciousness is eternal, how are the conditions obtaining in the waking, sleeping etc., states (of Consciousness) to be explained? The answer (to such a query) is: 'The burning quality of fire placed near a thing to be burnt is neutralised by the presence of a gem11 etc; in like manner the presence of a certain hinder- ing darkness produces sleep and other states. Also it is like (the state of) youth etc., for, virility (the state of youth) is latent in (the age of) infancy, but becomes manifest in (the age of) youth."1 

Consciousness is of the character of attribute (Guna), by virtue of the definition that what is dependent (on another, in an indiscerptible 

stream when the apprehension in the next moment is concerning the same object. Hence they are not two distinct Consciousnesses, the antecedent one dying, and the consequent one newly born as it were as the Madhyamika School of the Buddhists holds. 

"It is believed there are some gems or stones and other substances which paralyse the power of fire to burn.

manner) is its attribute (or quality), like the attributes (of substances). Also by virtue of its (Consciousness's) susceptibility to contraction and expansion, it partakes of the character of substance (Dravya.) How Consciousness, the attribute of the Soul (Atma), can be of the nature of substance, need not provoke doubt, for like the light, the same one substance can possess both the characteristics (of attribute and substance). Hence there is no contradiction."10 

Substance (Dravya) is enunciable as that which is the abode (or seat) of states (Avastha). Its radiation (or dispersion) outside its abode is possible like light (raying out from its centre). A syllogism (may be constructed) thus:- 

Attributive Consciousness is Substance, 

For it possesses the character of diffusion etc., Like light; 

or, 

Consciousness is Substance, 

* Like the "Blue Sky," where blueness is the inseparable adjunct of the sky. 

*1* This contention is perhaps better understood if we say that Consciousness is the faculty as well as the function of the soul.

For, apart from its connection (or source) unseen, it is cognisable, 220

For Consciousness as stated, is conceivable as capable of simultaneously coming in contact with infinite space, like rays emerging from the eye, Sun etc. The terms synonymous with Cons- ciousness are Mati, Prajñā, Samvit, Dhishaṇā, Dhih, Manishā, Šemushi, Medhā, Buddhi, etc. It is Consciousness which, affected by environ- ment, assumes the forms of joy, grief, desire, hate, and will; for there are no means (or proof), justifying the assumption of a generating Cause of joy etc., other than Consciousness. Like 'I remember' indicative of Consciousness, 'I desire,' 'I hate' (etc), indicate but a state of Consciousness. But how is the passage, which avers: 'Desire, will, doubt, zeal, indifference, courage, timidity, shame, sense (or reason) fear and all such, is Manas (mind), to be

construed as signifying forms (or states) of consciousness? This query is met by the answer that inasmuch as the invariable law holds, associating mind (Manas) as the instru- ment (or internal sense) of Consciousness, the use of the term mind to signify Consciousness (as in the above passage) is figurative (-ly justified). 

Likewise the qualities of the soul, which are numerous, are but the states of the attributive Consciousness, such (for example) as:-Per- ception, Inference, Word, Memory, Doubt, Conclusion, Difference, Fancy, Discernment, Endeavour, Temptation, Attachment, Hostility, Pride, Envy, Craving, Ostentation, Cupidity, Anger, Dignity, Stupor, Deceipt, Partiality, 

adhṛtir-, hrir-, dhir-, bbir-, etat sarvam mana eva." According to Occidental Philosophy, mind is im- material and is a function of, or a spiritual force operating on, the brain; but in Oriental Philosophy, mind is the internal material organ of sense, the Sense Commune, and Consciousness is the attribute of soul that streams out to the objective world, by first passing through the aperture, so to say, of the mind, thence to the external senses and out thence to external objects.

Gentleness (Mårdava) is the not bearing to be separated from one's dears. Rectitude (Arjava) is to be straight in thought, word and deed. Friendli- ness (Sauharda) is readiness to help others to the neglect of one's self. Impartiality (Sāmya) is to be equally accessible to all irrespective of their race, character or conduct. Compassion (Karunya) is the wish to repair others' ills to one's own detriment, or the inability to see others' sufferings. Sweetness (Madhurya) is to be sweet while nourishing, like milk. Dignity (Gambhirya) is the power which forbids the inquiry for deep motives underlying such acts as conferring abundance etc., on the devotees. Magnanimity (Audarya) is the feeling of dissatisfaction even after bestowing plenty. Tactfulness (Caturya) is the power to hide another's faults. Patience (Sthairya) is to be unruffled. Courage (Dhairya) is the power of permitting no waver, after decision.

The nature of God-love (bhakti)" and God- surrender (Prapatti)***—states of Consciousness --will briefly be discussed (now). It is God alone who confers Moksha (Final Release from material existence), on the (bare) plea (furnished by souls) of Love and Surrender. Hence these (latter) are considered as the Means to Release.

What is Karma-Yoga or the Path of Works? Through Holy Teaching (got), one acquires true knowledge regarding Soul and God; and, accord- ing to his best ability performs, without regard for fruit, diverse actions of virtue:-Kamya or Optional, Nitya or Routine, and Naimittika or Casual. The sum of acts so done is Karma- Yoga. It branches itself into God-worship, Austerities, Resort to Holy Places, Charity, Sacrifices etc. Effecting the riddance of stains on the soul, it engenders Jnana-Yoga or the Path of Knowledge, and through it or direct, engenders Bhakti-Yoga or the Path of Love." 

What is Jiana-Yoga or the Path of Know- ledge? By means of Karma-Yoga, one's heart (or mind, antah-karaṇa) becomes purified, and he then contemplates on the Soul which is dis- tinct from matter, and liege to God. This (contemplation or Jñāna-Yoga) is useful to Love (Bhakti.) Whether these Ways (or Paths) are Independent Means (to Salvation), or ancillary

to Love, depend upon the several authorities presenting such views. 

What is Bhakti-Yoga or the Path of Love? It is an unbroken stream of thought (of God) like a stream of (poured) oil, preceded by the eight-fold auxiliaries: Yama, Niyama (moral and physical restraints), Asana (postures), Prāṇā "yāma (restraint of breath), Pratya "hāra (restraint of senses), Dharana (steadying concentration), Dhyana (uninterrupted meditation), Samadhi (imperturbable fixture)." 

The seven-fold means known as (1) Viveka, (2) Vimoka, (3) Abhyāsa, (4) Kriyā, (5) Kal- yāṇa, (6) Anavasada and Anuddharsha, give birth to it (Bhakti). Of these, (1) Viveka or Discrimination is said to be the purity of body effected by abstention from food, impure from any cause. (2) Vimoka or Dispassion is freedom from desire. (3) Abhyasa or Practice is the repeated habit of clinging to the (mental) Sub- ject (or Image) (of contemplation). (4) Kriyā or Performance is the observance of the Fivefold 

The last three terms may perhaps be better translated by Abstraction, Devotion and Exaltation.

Maha-Yajnas or Great Sacrifices," according to one's ability. (5) Kalyāṇa or Virtues are Truth, Uprightness, Clemency, Non-cruelty and Non-cupidity. (6) Anavasāda or Painlessness is freedom from dejection (or despair). (7) Anud- dharsha or Non-elation is freedom from par- oxysmal joy; for such joy is also a hindrance. Fostered thus by this seven-fold Means, Love (Bhakti) becomes as vivid as actual perception and (this) must last till the (final) dissolution of the body occurs. This final (God-) conscious- ness may break (on a person) at the finis of this or some other body. 

Love or Bhakti, variously called Vedana, Dhyana and Upasana, has three successive stages, (1) Para-bhakti, (2) Para-jñāna and (3) Parama-bhakti. 20 Love again is twofold: 

" Vide 'Taittiriya Aranyaka' 3:-"Deva-yajħaḥ Pity-yajo, Bhuta-yajħo, Manushya-yojħo, Brahma yasha, iti." LE. Sacrifices to the Gods, the Manes, Creatures, Men and God.

But a query may arise why, when the Vedantas have prescribed Hearing (Šravaṇa) and Reflection (Manana) also, love (Bhakti or Nididhyāsana) alone is said to be enjoined. It is met thus: A person having learnt (the letter of) the Vedas with all its adjuncts, finds that the import of all this (learning) must have 'some definite motive; he necessarily resorts to Hearing (i.e. exposition by a Teacher) in order

to ascertain for himself what it (the end) may be. Hence Hearing as a necessary step is premised. Reflection then (on what was taught) is also premised inasmuch as it is a (mental) process intended to render steady what has been heard.* Hence there is no inconsistency when it is averred that the purpose (of the Vedas) is to prescribe Love (Bhakti). Love which in other words is meditation (Dhyana), becomes mani- fold by the diversity of its Methods (Vidyā). These Methods (of Love or Meditation) are sub- sumable under two main heads: (1) those that have for their fruit (aim) Material Goods, or Spiritual End (Mukti). The Udgita-Vidya etc., belong to the Material Class. Those that belong to the Spiritual Class or the Brahma-Vidyā, are such as the Antar-akshi-Vidya, Antara-'ditya- Vidya, Dahara-Vidya, Bhuma-Vidya, Sad-Vidya, Madhu-Vidyā, Upakosala-Vidyā, Šāṇḍilya- Vidya,

Further descant on this topic is debarred by reason of this work having been designed for the enlightenment of the young; it has to be learnt from the properly constituted apostolic authorities, out of esoteric treatises (Rahasyas) etc.

Amongst those (religionists) who stand outside the pale of the Vedas, some do not admit the entity Soul at all, as apart from the body; to them the very subject of Deliverance (Moksha) is futile." Nor is it less abortive to those others who believe consciousness to be momentary, which to them is itself the Soul.

THE SOUL (Jiva). 

The (category) Soul or Jiva will now be ex- plained. The characteristics common to Soul and God are: Interiority (pratyaktva), Cognos- citiveness (cetanatva), Spiritness (ātmatva), and Agency (kartṛtva). 

Pratyaktua or Interiority means to be self- luminous. Cetanatva or Cognoscitiveness is to be the seat (or involucre) of consciousness. Atmatva or Spiritness is to be the antithesis to body (matter). Kartṛtva or Agency is to be the seat of consciousness, of the form of Will (sankalpa). 

Having thus stated the common characteris- tics of Soul, the special (or singular) charac- teristics will now be stated. Atomic cum Cog- noscitive, Liegent cum Cognoscitive; similarly, Sustained, Contingent, Agent by delegation, Subject, and so forth; may be conceived (as qualities distinguishing the Soul).

The Soul is distinct from body, senses, mind (manas), breath, and intellect. Distinct from body (Soul is) by reason of the experience: 'My body'; Distinct from the outer senses by reason of the experiences: 'I see with (my) eyes', 'I hear with (my) sense of hearing', 'I speak with my tongue' and so forth; Distinct from mind (manas) as this is known to be a sense; from breath as indicated by the expression: 'My breath', and from Intellect (buddhi) as borne out by the experience: 'I know'. It is atomic (or monadic) by reason of the Šruti (= Scriptures) stating that it (Soul) out-goes (from the body at time of leaving, and in-comes to the body at time of joining), confirmed by (our own) experience. No question need arise how, if Soul is atomic, it is capable of cognising simultaneously many ob- jects, for (its) attributive consciousness has the capacity for such diffusion. By this (law), the 

***Atomic' has a material significance which is not meant, as the Soul, is spiritual. What is intend. ed to be conveyed is that Soul is a subtle spiri- tual centre of consciousness, a focus of the forces of consciousness which can ray out anywhere, like the central sun diffusing its rays anywhere.

assumption of many bodies (simultaneously) by such (sages) as Saubhari," and by the Freed (Muktas) becomes possible. This (Soul) is Eternal, for it remembers what was experienced in the past. But it may be asked: how if Soul is eternal, they do speak of its being born' and 'dead'? We reply that birth is because of the Soul's bondage with body, and death is, because of its severance therefrom. Hence the nature of the Soul is Eternal. It is distinct for each distinct body. In a similar manner as the singular of the expression 'gold jar' is made use of for an 'aggregate' of gold jars, all of the same dimensions, and 'grain' is used for an accumulation of grains, is the (generic) term Soul used, as all souls share in common the attribute of consciousness. Hence there is no identity, as that conflicts with the Authorities.

2** See Vishnu-Purāņa [IV-2] for the story. 

240 This is with reference to the advaitic (monistic) theory that all souls are identical; whereas Autho- rities such as the Vedas mean otherwise, i. e. assert plurality or multiplicity of souls.

It is by nature Blissful (or essentially Joyous); but, infected by environment (upadhi), falls into migration (samsāra). It is Agent (kartā), enjoyer (bhoktā), the Bodied (šariri) and body (Sarira). It is the bodied with reference to matter; with reference to God (Išvara), it is body. 

That it is Self-luminous (svayam-prakāša) is evident from Perception as well as Word (Scriptures). A syllogism may be constructed as follows:- 

"The Soul is Self-luminous.' 

For it is conscious, (or cognoscitive). Like the attributive consciousness.' 

Consciousness-ness (jñānatva) and Stainless- ness (or Sinlessness amalatva) etc., are qualities which determine its (Soul's) Essence. 

Thus the thesis of the Bauddhas that as cons- ciousness is momentary, Soul is the concatenat- ion of (such) moments;-the thesis of the Cārvākas that Soul is conterminous with the body, which is a compound of Four Elements; -the thesis of the Jainas that Soul is commensu- rate with the elephant's body in the elephant,

and commensurate with the ant's body in the ant;-the thesis of Yadava that Soul is a frag- ment of God (Brahman);—the thesis of Bhaskara that Soul is a division of the conditioned God (Brahman); the thesis that Soul is a fabrication (effected) by nescience;-the thesis that Soul is multipled by reason of the limiting (or circum- scribing) Inner Organ (Antaḥkarana); all other such objectionable theses are disannulled; and likewise the contention for its (Soul's) infinitive nature (vibhutva). 

But if it be asked, how, in case of not admitting the infinitive character of Soul, is its fruit in con- nection with other realms, determined by the 'unseen' (destiny = adṛsha), possible, the reply is that though Soul has no local (or spatial) relation, yet the Unseen (destiny) determines it. What is Destiny? It is a species of consciousness attained as a consequence of good deeds done for winning the pleasure of God (Bhagavan). This conscious- ness is none other than Providence (or Will) of God, contingent on His infinitive (vibhu) nature. 

* The purport of this is that it is God's providence that watches our behaviour, and rewards us. See Vedanta-Sutras; Phalan ata upapattel' [III. 2. 37.]

(In) thus (predicating) the reaping of fruit (by the Soul), is not beset with difficulties. 

This Soul is threefold: Bound (Baddha), Freed (Mukta), and Free or Eternal (Nitya). Of these the Bound are those particular group of souls, from Brahma down to the worm, inha- biting the fourteen worlds comprising the 'Oval Sphere.' Brahma is sprung from the navel-lotus of Šriman-Nārāyaṇa; Rudra from Brahmā; from Brahma again are sprung the Yogis Sanaka etc., the Devarshis Narada etc., the Brahmarshis Vasishtha etc, the Nine Prajapatis, Pulastya, Marici, Daksha, Kasyapa etc. From these sprang the Devas, the Regents of the Quarters (Dik-palakas), the Fourteen Indras, the Fourteen Manus, the Asuras, Pitrs, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Vidya- dharas etc., the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, the Ašvinis, and the Danavas, Yakshas, Rakshasas Pišacas, Guhyakas etc. Thus there are many varieties of creatures of Deva-Origin. The human class also has many varieties such as Brāhmaṇas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras etc. So also is the animal species such as cattle, beasts, birds, reptiles, moths, worms etc. The

the text:- 

"That (consousness) is meagre in the lowest forms of lif" 

241 

Thus the Bound (Baddha souls) are of the classes: Devas (celestial or superhuman), human animal And stationary 

There are again (differently) classifiable as womb born, egg-born, seed-born and sweat- born. The Devas and man are womb-bon, (but) among them Brahma, Rudra etc., Sanaka etc., Sita, Draupadi, rshadyumna etc., are not thus born (ayonija), spare the Bhutas, Bhe- tāļas etc. The animals are (some) womb- born, (some) egg-born, and (some) sweat-born. The Stationary etc, are seed-born."

These (souls again) are of two classes: (1) Subject to Šāstra, and (2) Non-subject to Šāstra. Among these, liability to Sastra pertain to those Bound (souls) who have the (moral) consciousness dependant on the several senses. Such is not the case with animals and stationary (creatures).

happiness (bubhukshu) and coveters of spiritual happiness (mumukshu). The former cling to the Triad of life-ambitions. These (again) are of two classes: those that cling to Wealth and Delights, and those that cling to Duty. The former are those who labour under the notion that body is soul. The latter are those who are launched on Sacrifices (yajña), Charity (dāna), Austerities (tapas), Pilgrimage (tirtha- yātrā) etc., all falling under the head 'Duty' as per the enunciation :— 

'Duty is that which paves the way for happi- ness to come (alaukika)' 

and, 

'Duty is that which is the Way (or means), established by (incentive) Injunction.'"** 

348 The four ambitions of life are: (1) Dharma (duty) (2) artha (wealth) (3) kāma (delights) and (4) moksha (redemption). (1), (2) and (3) constitute the Triad, called Traivargika, and (4) is the Apavarga. 

240 

[Jaimini-Sūtras; I. 1. 2]; 'Codanā-lakshaṇoiya 'rtho dharmaḥ," ie., the injunctions of the Scriptures (alaukika) alone provide the incentive to duty, which done, does not bring to the man immediate result as would accrue to a worldly effort on which an im- mediately realisable corresponding fruit is always contingent.

These are believers in the Soul as distinct from the body, and in that there is the other (highest or spiritual) world to come. The par- tisans of Duty (dharma) are of two classes (again): those, adherents of other deities; and those, of God (Bhagavan). The adherents of other deities are the worshippers of Brahma, Rudra etc. The adherents of God are those 

devotees who come under the text: 

1 

'The aggrieved, the seeker, the ambitious &c." 

247 

The aggrieved (arta) is he who has lost his fortune and is desirous of recovering it. The ambitious (arthärthi) is he who longs to grow rich anew. The Seekers (of redemption, Mu- mukshu) are of two classes, viz., those who - wish for Isolation (kaivalya) and those who wish for Divinity (moksha). Kaivalya or Iso- lation is the meta-physical soul-bliss secured by the Path of Knowledge (jana). This Soul-bliss is isolate from God-bliss, and is experienced in a Corner of the Spiritual Universe,-in the manner

24 Some opine that as those who have travelled along the Path of Light can no more return, there is a Corner assigned in the Physical Universe itself, where they are absorbed in their own Soul-bliss (ātmā-'nubhava). 

The Aspirers for Divinity or God-bliss are of two kinds: (1) The God-lovers (bhaktas), and (2) the God-leaners (prapannas). The God-lovers are those who have learnt the Vedas with all its limbs and the Upanishads (širaska), become versed in the metaphysics of the Vedas, early and later parts thereof, thereby acquiring the Knowledge of God (Brahman), as Him who is distinct from (the Categories) of Conscients (cit) and Non-conscients (acit),-as Him whose essen- tial nature is bliss, exalted and measureless,—as Him who is hostile to all evil and full of all Holy Graces; and then resort to the Path of Love (bhakti) leading to Him, thereby aspiring to reach salvation (moksha).

The Šūdras are not entitled thereto, for reasons argued out in the Apa-sudra Section.260 

The Character of (God-) Love has been delineated in the Section on Consciousness (VII). The (God-)Lovers are of two kinds: (1) those who practise love with a Motive (sādhana), and (2) those who practise the same as an End in itself (sadhya).

The aspirer for the Triad is he who longs for the ful- filments of duty, for wealth and for joys." The aspirer for emancipation (or the Supreme Goal) is he who by association with the good (and wise) has acquired discrimination of what is lasting and what fleeting, what transcendent and what insignificant, and thereby loses all relish (vairāgya) for worldliness (samsära) and pants for salvation (moksha).

The Freed (mukta or the Absolved) is he who has accepted the Path, and performs all duties: routine, casual, and all decrees of the Divine, primary and secondary, for the sake of duty. He avoids all offences against God and the Godly; and at the time of casting off the body,

Hence the Absolved Soul, ever in harmony with the Will of the Lord (Bhagavān), freely every- where tours. 

The Eternals (Nityas or the Ever-Free), are those whose function is never at variance with the Will of the Lord (Bhagavān), and never therefore are they subject to their consciousness (ever) becoming dimmed. They are Ananta, Garuda, Vishvaksena and others. The functions appointed them in perpetuity are determined by the Eternal Will of God.

In all religions, the portrayal of this blessed state is necessarily made in material language. The saints of Christianity are, for example, said to be crowned with palms and amaranths, and perpetually singing hallelujas to God. Metaphorical language is thus unavoidable; but this is certain that whether such language be of the con- ventional type germane to the genius of the European or of the Asiatic, the idea of the blessed state is never of the sensual but of the spiritual, quite a different order therefore of existence.

GOD (Išvara). 

Now (the category of) God (Išvara) will be inquired into. The characteristics of God are All-Lordship, All-Mastership, All-worshipfulness by work, All-fruit-givership, All-Support, All- energising, All-Word-indicated, All-knowledge- goal, All-bodiedness excepting His own body and consciousness.❤ 

God thus indicated is the Material (or Formal) Cause of the Universe by virtue of His aspect as the constituted of the Conscients and Non-cons- cients (cid-acid-višishtaḥ); is the Efficient (or Spiritual) Cause by virtue of His aspect as the Willer; and is the Instrumental Cause by virtue of His immanence in Time etc. The Material Cause is that which results as Effect by under- going modification. The Efficient Cause is that 

The epigrammatic style here employed, is, it is hoped, sufficiently lucid. It at any rate obviates the nesessity for otherwise long-phrasing, detracting from the poetry attaching to terseness.

which causes modifications so as to result into Effect. The Instrumental Cause is that which helps the resulting into Effect. Or this- wise: The Material Cause is that inevitable antecedent state adequate to effectuate the immediate consequent state; as illustrated by the consequent state of being the jar effect- ed from the antecedent state of being the clod of earth. The Effective Cause is that which is required to be different from the modification (or the modifying). In this case the Instrumental Cause is included in the Effective (cause). Whichever be the position adopted, the three-foldness or the two-foldness of the Cause, the characteristics of Cause is evident, and this is found in the (Prime) Cause of the Universe, the Blessed All-God (Bhaga- vān Nārāyaṇa). 

If it be asked how in Nārāyaṇa rests (or abides) the (ultimate) causality, the reply is:-Such con- clusion is arrived at after an examination of all the Vedanta Texts (bearing on the question), rationally argued out. Thus: To begin with, matter cannot be the Cause of the Universe, for

it is devoid of thinking etc. In the Chhandogya (-Upanishat) however, that which is indicated by the terms: Sat, Ākāša (Ether), Prāṇa, is seen to be (stated as) the Cause of the Universe. In the Vājasaneyaka (Up°), the term Brahman is discovered (to be so). By the canon known as the resultant import of all the branches (of the Veda)","" all the texts which relate to Cause (of the Universe) must be interpreted to signify one Specific Object. Hence terms of general import such as Sat (Being) etc., must ultimately connote the specific Brahman, according to the (ana- logical) rule of 'goat-animal. In the manner

260 Known as the Chaga-pašu-nyaya, which means that when an animal is mentioned as eligible for sacrifice, the question necessarily arises as to what animal is particularly meant. 'Goat' is the answer, which is decisive. Hence general terms such as sat etc., find their ultimate decisive significance in a definite (specific) term, which is found to be Nārā- yana, by an examination of the various generic terms bearing on the subject and which are scattered in various parts of the Veda.

aforesaid, the term Brahman is next circumscrib- able into the (more specific) term Atman found in the Aitareya (-Upanishat). What then is in- dicated by this term Ãtman,—the Vedic celebrity Indra? Or Agni, of similar report? Or Surya, known as the adorable? Or Soma, said to be the Cause? Or Kubera, known to be the bestower of whatever is desired? Or Yama? Or Varuņa? When such doubt arises, they (deities or demi- gods) may be disposed of as incapable of being the Cause of the Universe, by reason of their being known, to be subject to karma and pos- sessed of limited affluence. 

But in the Švetasvatara (-Upanishat), it is apparent that Šiva is (stated to be) the Cause (of the Universe). Similarly in the Atharva- Šikhā (-Upanishat), the entity designated Šam- bhu is mentioned as the object of adoration and as Cause. Likewise in the Atharva-Širas (-Upanishat), the entity designated as Rudra is stated to be the Soul of all (things). And in the Taittiriya, Hiranya-garbha is men- tioned as the Cause of the Universe. In all these cases, applying the canon (of interpretation)142 

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ

[Advent 

known as the Generic-Specific (sāmānya- višesha-nyāya), the fact of the general terms Šiva, Šambhu and Rudra finding their speci- fic significance in Hiranyagarbha will be clear. Again if the radical (or etymological) sense of the term Šiva be considered, it means well or good (or auspicious) as may be seen from the usages: Let it be well with all the Universe', 'Let the deed be good', 'Let thy path be good' etc. Similarly Rudra signifies Agni-(fire). Hence, judged by the etymological force of such common terms as Mahešvara, Šambhu etc., they find their particular significance in the Fourfaced (entity, Hiranyagarbha). 

But a protest may be entered why the terms Šiva etc., referred to as the Cause (of the Kosmos) should not through their primary signi- ficance, (be construed to) indicate Rudra? This cannot be done, inasmuch as the origination of Rudra (Šiva) is narrated (in the Scriptures) as happening from the Four-faced (Demiurge), and Rudra is not free from (the taints of) sin; and therefore cannot constitute the Cause, (of the Universe). Hence terms such as Šiva etc., receive

their ultimate connotation as the Four-faced, severally designated as Hiranyagarbha, Prajā- pati, Svayambhūḥ etc.,27 

By a similar ratiocination, the terms Sva- yambhūḥ, Hiranyagarbha and Prajapati may be traced up to (the Ultimate Source) Nārāyaṇa, for Nārāyaṇa, as the Supreme Cause, as the Being that all terms connote, as the Saviour (moksha- prada), as the Kosmos-bodied etc., is proved in the Mahopanishat, Nārāyan-opanishat, Subal- opanishat, Maitrāyaṇiya (-Upanishat), Purusha- sūkta, Nārāyaṇa- 'nuvāka, Antaryāmi-Brāhmaṇa etc. Hence Nārāyaṇa alone is the Cause of all the Kosmos, and the Knowable of all sciences. 

No doubt need arise that the Science (of God) called the Antar-aditya-vidya may relate to Rudra, for from a majority of authorities (Script- ures), it is proved that it relates to Vishņu. The term Bharga is not to be understood as (a mas- culine-indicating) termination: A (31). Nor need a doubt arise that in the Science, Dahara-vidya,

[Advent 

the term Ākāša implying Nārāyaṇa, has Rudra for its In-dwelling (antaryāmi), for the In-dwell- ing there referred to are the auspicious graces or perfections inhering in Nārāyaṇa. In this same way the interpretations of all the Sciences (Vidyas) may be conceived. 200 

The inference thus is that He who is possessed of all Holy Graces, Perfections, Glories, Who is distinct from matter (prakṛti) and soul (purusha), Who is constituted of these, the Supreme Brah- man, viz., Nārāyaṇa, is the Cause of the Kosmos. 

But it may be alleged that according to the monistic (advaita) texts (of the Scriptures), Brahman alone is real and undifferentiated (=devoid of attributes); what is fancied in it (Brahman) as the 'being cognizer' (subject) and as the 'being cognized' (object) etc., is illusory; Brahman (itself) in consequence of nescience (avidyā) revolves in material life (samsāra); the monistic knowledge gained from such texts as:

dispels it (i. e. samsāra or avidya). When thus, views such as these held by other schools, go to establish the sense of the Vedanta (texts) to point to an undifferentiated Brahman, which is but consciousness absolute, how could they connote Nārāyaṇa, and the discourse (hold) that He is possessed of all the Holy Graces (or Excellent Attributes)? The reply to this is thus:-From the texts referring to the Cause (of the Universe), Nārāyaṇa has been shown as the Cause; the conflict that seems to exist between the dua- 

listic and monistic texts is reconcilable by means of the reconciling (or arbitration, ghataka) texts; the texts that seem to import non-differentia- tion (or quality-lessness) are interpretable as meaning absence of evil qualities; as there is no authority by which to suppose a nes- cience, consequent on which the notions 'cog- nizer' and the 'cognizer' come to be fancied, the Effect (generating) from Brahman is real; if by nescience, Brahman itself rolls into mate- rial life as Soul (Jiva), the faults pertaining to the Soul necessarily attach to Brahman, and no other agent (than Brahman) can be conceived 

19

as the banisher (of that material life). As therefore the contention of monism cannot be sustained, no undifferentiated Brahman, as but mere consciousness is established; ergo, Brahman is full of exquisite Graces, and is Nārāyaṇa, Who is the Source of the Kosmos, and Bestower of eternal bliss (moksha) etc. 

Brahman, as constituted of the Subtle, Cons- cient (cit) and the Non-conscient (acit) alone is the Cause of the Kosmos; and as constituted of the Gross Conscient and Non-conscient, alone is the Effect. Thus the creed of the Višishta- dvaita Vedāntins is that no Cause is different from its Effect."70 

As God (Įšvara) is admitted, the views of the 170 This is the law of Correlation. Every Effect has its own antecedent Cause to which it is correlat-

Schools of God-less Sankhya, the Mimāṁsakas etc., are exploded. As Material Causality is pre- dicated (by us) of this same (God), the views of the Schools of Yoga, Pašupata and Naiyāyika are confuted, for their admission of God is con- fined to His Efficient Causation only. 

In the same manner as Material as well as Efficient causation is ascribable to God, are ascribable to Him the faculties of action, stimu- lation, governance, illuminance, permission, suc- cour, neutrality and so forth. 

In the same manner as the imperfections (known as) childhood, youth etc., pertain to the body (Sarira), not the body-holder (Sariri), the soul, so is it in the case of the All-Soul (Para- mātman), the bodied of Soul (cit) and Non- soul (acit). There is thus no conflict with the Šruti (Scriptures) which proclaims the un- modifiable (character of God). As a rule, what is cognised as 'body' in the world is what possesses the properties of being 'sus- tained' (adheyatva), 'controlled' (vidheyatva), and subordinated' (šeshatva) (by Soul); the Kosmos is the 'body' of God; but, the

imperfections pertaining to the body do not effect Him. 

This God (Išvara) is infinitive (vibhu). To be infinite is to be pervading. This (pervasion) is threefold: (1) By essence, (2) By attributive consciousness, (3) By representation (vigraha). He is called boundless (Ananta). Boundless means the negation of the three kinds of limi- tations. The three kinds of limitations are those (1) by space, (2) by time and (3) by thing. 

The qualities of Truth (satyatva), Holiness (amalatva), Illimitability (anantatva), betoken the essential nature of God; the qualities of Omniscience (jñāna), Omnipotence (šakti) etc., describe Him, on such (essential) characteris- ation. The qualities of Omniscience, Omni- potence etc., are requisite for purposes of Crea- tion. The qualities of Love, Meekness, Acces- sibility etc., are requisite for suasion (to souls) to take shelter. The qualities of Mercy etc., are useful for purposes of protection. The import of these qualities has been discussed in the Sec tion on Consciousness, and no expatiation here is therefore called for.

This God first created the (Mundane) Egg; and then by His immanency in the Four-faced (Catur- mukha), Daksha, Time etc., continues creation. He becomes the Protector by incarnating as Vishņu, abiding in Manu, Time etc., and direct- ly Himself. He is Destroyer by His indwelling in Rudra, Time, the destroyer (Yama) etc. Hence He is the Creator, Protector and Destroyer. 

God as thus depicted assumes five aspects: (1) Para or the Transcendent, (2) Vyuha or the Grouped, (3) Vibhava or the Incarnated, (4) Antaryāmi or the Immanent, and (5) Archā or the Imaged. The Para is Nārāyaṇa, variously called by the names Parabrahma etc., Vasudeva etc., Who, four-armed, and beaming with His beatific presence, is exalted on the throne poised on its eight supports Dharma etc., with Šesha over the seat, erected in the gemmed pavilion in the Divine Hall, guarded by the sentries: Canda, Pracanda, Bhadra, Subhadra, Jaya, Vijaya, Dhatri, Vidhātri etc., in the Vaikuntha-named- City of the Thrice-Magnificent Land,” protected

are reckoned as by far the most renowned. They are the unique incarnations: the Matsya, the Kurma etc. Of these the Matsya Incarna- tion was undertaken in order to overcome the Daityas who stole the Vedas, and restore them (viz., the Authority) to Brahma. The Kurma Incarnation was undertaken in order to extract ambrosia (amṛta), (from the Milk Sea), calculated to bestow (lasting) health and immortality on beings. The Varaha Incarnation was undertaken in order to raise His Consort (Earth from the ocean) that He may (thus) exemplify his power to) lift creatures drowned in the Ocean of worldliness (samsāra). The Narasimha Incar- nation was undertaken with a view to protect his protege (Prahlada) and kill the Asura (Hiranya-kašipu),-by springing out of a pillar. The Vamana Incarnation was undertaken in order to cleanse the worlds by means of water issuing from his lotus-feet (i.e. Gangā), by the transfigured (from Vamana) Trivikrama. The Parašurāma Incarnation was taken for the purpose of exterminating the wicked Kshatriyas. The Rama Incarnation was undertaken in order

Full (Purna), Partial (Amša), and Obsessing (Āveša). Amongst these, the distinction of Worshippable and Non-worshippable must be borne in mind. 

The reason for incarnating, is (God's own) Will, not Karma. As for the motif (for incar- nating), it is to protect the good, by destroying the wicked. 

The Immanent phase is that of abidance in the regions of the heart of the Soul through all its states of experience in heavens, hells etc., as the Souls' (constant) Friend, and realisable by Yogis. Though co-dwelling with the Soul (Easternal Partner), He is intact of taints affecting it. 

The Image-Incarnation is the species of Forms presented (for worship), in homes, hamlets, cities, selected hills etc., devoid of distances interposed by space and time; deigning to descend with His immaterial (i.e., spiritual) Person into any material substance as may lovingly be chosen by 

I. e,, a necessitation contingent on the perfor- mance of an interested deed, but no such interested- ness of a selfish character can abide in the Deity. Hence His Incarnations emanate from a perfectly Free Will.

Four varieties of this (aspect) exist viz., Self-manifest (Svayam-Vyakta), Superhuman or Celestial (Daiva), Saint-made (Saiddha) and Man-made (Manusha).” 

In all the Quintuple Hypostases aforesaid, God is ever present with Šri (or Grace, His Consort). So Šruti and other Authorities dec- lare. And therefore the view of those one- sided partisans who contend for Šri-lessness, is exploded. (The Category of) God has thus been propounded.

ADVENT X.. 

THE NON-SUBSTANCE (Adravya). 

After the treatment thus given to (the Cate- gory) Substance (Dravya), that of non-substance will now be taken up. 

Non-substance is divisible into ten classes only vis. :—(1, 2, 3), the pure, motile or motive and dark (qualities inherent in matter), (4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Sound, Touch, Colour, Savour, Odour, (9) con- junction (Samyoga), and (10) Force (Šakti). 

Satva or Pureness is the non-Substance (or Quality) which is the root-cause of brightness, happiness, buoyancy etc., non-sensible, and other than force etc. It is of two kinds: Absolute Pureness (Šuddha-satva) and mixed or Alloyed Pureness (Mišra-satva). Absolute Pureness is the Pureness inherent in Substance, devoid from restlessnessness (Rajas) and dark- ness (Tamas). This (exists) in the Eternal Expanse (i. e. Spiritual Regions). Metaphori- cally (or secondarily) it is ascribed to God 

X.] 

· 

THE NON-SUBSTANCE 

157 

(Isvara), its Initiator. The Mixed Pureness is so called by reason of the association of pure- ness with restlessnessness and darkness. This pervades the Triune (= matter) and is tropically (or secondarily) attributed to the soul (Jwa) consorting with it (matter). 

Rajas or restlessness is the non-Substance (or Quality), which is the root-cause of passion, desire, greed, activity etc., non-sensible and other than force etc. 

Tamas, darkness (or Dross) is the non-Sub- stance (or Quality), which is the root-cause of infatuation, inattention, listlessness etc., non- sensible and other than force etc. 

These three (qualities) permeate matter con- terminously; adhere to the soul (which is) in bond- age with matter; non-eternal; constantly fluxing; equipoised in the state of Dissolution (prafaya); agitated in the state of Creation (sṛshti); use- ful for the processes of Creation, Continuance and Dissolution; and are the cause of the mutual contrarieties existing (in the Universe) determined by the dispensations or bent of God's Will. These (properties) are common (to this 

158 

YATINDRA-MATA-DĪPIKĀ 

[Advent 

Triad). (The differentiæ are):-The Satva Quality is the cause of blessedness born of lucid knowledge etc., and productive of Redemption (moksha). The Rajas Quality is the cause of pain etc., born of attachment &c., begot by karma, and the means of bringing the supra- mundane (fruits) such as Svarga, Naraka, etc. The Tamas Quality is the cause of ignorance, lethargy etc., and productive of Damnation (naraka). Hence Satva etc., are Qualities; and not possessed of the characteristics of Sub- 

stance. 

Sound which abides in all the Five Elements is that which we cognize by the sense of hearing. It is of two descriptions: articulate and non- articulate. The Fifty Letters (of the alphabet), A, K, C, T, T, P, Y, etc., comprise the articulate (sound), and this is utterable by means of the palate etc., by gods, men etc. The non-articulate (sound) is such as that emanating from a drum 

*The Law of Action and Re-action. On the moral plane it is the Nemesis or the Law of Retri- bution. When this Law is transcended, the state is that of Redemption (Moksha).

etc. By the ear is sound, so described, apprehen- sible. Either by the sense (of hearing) emanant, or the excitative air vibrant, is sound perceived. But Scriptures speak of sound as Substance; how then can it be non-substance (i. e. quality)? The escape (from this objection) consists in showing that the composition of Praṇava (Aum) by its components A (3) etc., is made through what is signified (by A etc., viz; Ākāša)." 

Touch is that Quality which we perceive by the sense of touch (in skin), other and separate (than those of the other senses). This is of three kinds: cold, warm and equable (tem- 

174 

""" Though as a constituent part in a compound, and as cause to an effect, the constituent may bear the semblance of a substance, yet the fact that the constituent is so by means of its origin from, or dependency on, a medium makes it partake the characteristic of a non-substance, as for example, the sound A, though a material (or substantial) cause to produce Aum the effect, it is a quality by reason of its origination from, or dependency on, the substance Akaša or Ether. The significant (vācaka) is A, the signified (väkya) by that significant is Ether, of which the significant in the present case is as quality or attribute to substance. 

160 

YATİNDRA-MATA-DIPIKĀ 

[Advent 

perature). The cold touch is (perceivable) in water, the warm in fire, the equable in earth and air. Also it (touch) is divisible into what is modified, or effected (a product-pākaja) and what is unmodified or uneffected (causal or elementary a-pakaja). The former is in earth; the latter is in the other three (viz., ether, fire and water). The touch pertaining in a special manner, to (such things as) nectar, poison, pearl, silk, stone, cow, Brahmaṇa, Caṇḍala" etc., is classifiable under the head 'effected.' 

577 Physically, any combination or integration brought about by natural agencies, chiefly by fire, is a product. The quality of touch undergoes change by these processes. These maturatory physical pro- cesses, carry with them moral or spiritual conse quences pari-passu. Thus a Canḍāja is a low-caste personage. He becomes the 'untouchable' because he has so become by all the modifications produced by conditions such as natal, sacramental, social and moral; and the environments comprised of loathsome habits in food, drink, and marriage. If according to Matthew ix. 20, 21, a woman touching the hem of Jesus is sanotified, there is meaning in the doc. trine that touching unclean objects contacts pollution. There is physical as well as moral contagion accord- ing to Brahmanic doctrines.

Colour is that Quality which is perceived by our sense of sight (eye) alone, other and sepa- rate (than the other qualities). It is of four kinds: white, red, yellow and dark. White of varieties is the colour found in silver, conch, shell, moon etc. Red of varieties is found in fire, rose, pomegranate, bandhu-jiva, "s coral, ruby etc. Yellow of varieties is the colour found in gold, saffron, turmeric etc. Dark of varie- ties is the colour found in sapphire, bee, cloud, night (or darkness), tamala," grass etc. Some, following the Śruti 200, hold the view that yellow is a species of red. As an alternative (classific- ation), colour is twofold: radiant and non-radiant. Radiant is (what is found) in (self-) luminous (objects); the non-radiant is (what is found) in

Savour is the Quality perceptible to our sense of taste (tongue), other and of different species (than the rest of the qualities). It is of six kinds; sweet, sour, saline, bitter, pungent, and astrin- gent. The sweet varieties are of (such articles as) sugar-cane, milk, sugar etc. The sour varieties are of the mango, tamarind, myro- balan-fruit etc. The saline varieties are of salt, saline products etc. The bitter varieties are of kimpāka," margosa etc. The pungent varieties are of ginger, pepper, mustard etc. The astringent varieties are of the yellow myrobalan (gallnut) vibhitaki, "* mango-sprout etc. 

Odour is the Quality apprehensible by our sense of smell (nose), other and of a different order (than the other qualities). It is of two

kinds: odour and mal-odour. The varieties of odour (or fragrance) are of sandal, musk, saffron, campaka 20 etc. The mal-odours are what may be found in others than these. Odour is specifically of the earth, and varieties spring out of its modifications. The perception of odour in air, water etc., is by reason of its impregnation with earth and is tropically so (used) like the expression 'iron burns.' " Though all quali- ties may abide in all the elements in virtue of their (elements') quintuplicity, (the assignment of) particular qualities (to particular elements) is by reason of (their) predominancy. There is thus no contradiction. The change of quality, consequent on maturation, (or modification a substance may undergo) occurs in its own sub-stratum (i.e. in the same substance). When this (change) is explicable by the non-disappearance of its own substratum, the tenet that the atoms (them- selves) undergo change is untenable."

Conjunction (Samyoga) is the (Quality which is the) cause of the cognition of the conjunct (objects). This quality is universal to the Six Substances.*6 

The contradiction of its non-existence as well as existence in the substratum, is accountable by the fact of the substratum having diverse parts. 987 Conjunction (a Quality) is both of the non- eternal and of the eternal character. The former (subsists) in limited (objects) by the impulse of both the 'conjunct' (objects) as two goats or two duellists (rushing towards each other for combat), or by the impulse of one, as of a hawk perching on a post. Some talk of a Conjunction

originating from a Conjunction, for example the conjunction of a book with the body, arising from its (book's) conjunction with the hand; but we say no, inasmuch as one conjunction- hand with book-implies the other, and no two successive conjunctions, therefore, one springing from the other (need predication). For similar reasoning, the origination of a Disjunction from another Disjunction is also discarded. Disjunct- ion (Vibhaga or Viyoga) is none other than the negation of Conjunction of bodies; hence it is not a distinct Quality. The Eternal (kind of) Conjunction is between infinite (vibhu) substances. Conjunction of eternal (lit. non-originated=aja) substances, is admitted by Šruti (Vedas); by Inference also the Con- junction of eternal substances is establishable thus:- 

'An infinite substance has conjunction with an infinite substance, 

For it is substance, 

Like the jar'; 

(or), 

and not exists at its bottom, which is its (steeple's)

Now, Force is that particular non-Substance (i. e. Quality) which stands as the reason of all causation. This is made evident both by Infer- 

*** An objection is raised; how can two or more infinites be conjoined, inasmuch as conjunction implies partition; but when there is partition or division, the substance cannot be infinite? This objection is met by saying that infinites are eternally conjoined and never brought about in time, and hence possible; and this is supported by the Reve- lations (Šruti). The conjunction therefore is of the metaphysical, ideal, or spiritual description, and there- fore bears no analogy to physical or spatial conjunc- tions, except the mere fact of conjunction. What is meant is the co-substantiality of infinites; that is, two or more infinites can co-exist, their infinitiveness remaining unaffected.

ence as well as Scriptures (Agama). That Force (or Power) which is not palpable to the senses, is that by which fire ceases to burn when obstructed by the presence of such things as gems, charms etc., though there is no paucity of substance to help its nature (i. e., help fire to burn). The existence of such (power) is evident in the magnet. This power abides in (all) the Six Substances." The abidance (of Force) in God (Bhagavan) is stablished by the 'Gem- Purāņa' (=Vishnu Purāņa) etc. Hence the Quality known as Force (or Power) is dis- coverable universally. 

But if it be asked how when Qualities have been enumerated as Twenty-four, only Ten

389 I.e., (1) Matter, (2) Time, (3) Pure Matter, (4) Attributive Consciousness, (5) Soul, (6) God. [See Advent IV]. 

20 The Sixteen according to Tarka-Samgraha are: (1) Colour, (2) Savour, (3) Odour, (4) Touch, (5) Number, (6) Extension, (7) Severalty, (8) Con- junction, (9) Disjunction, (10) Priority, (11) Poster- iority, (12) Gravity, (13) Fluidity, (14) Viscidity, (15) Sound, (16) Thought, (17) Pleasure, (18) Pain, (19) Desire, (20) Aversion, (21) Will, (22) Virtue, (23) Vice, (24) Faculty.

[Advent 

have been recognised, the reply is: that as al- ready shown, the Six (Qualities) Thought, Plea- sure, Pain, Desire, Aversion and Will (or Effort) are but states of Consciousness-qualities or attributes of the Soul (Jivâ-"tmā). Virtue and Vice, contingent (respectively) on the Grace and Wrath of God, are resolvable into the Consciousness of God. The Power of Imagination is resolvable into a state of Cons- ciousness, the Power of Momentum is account- able from the cause of Momentum (Energy), and the Power of Elasticity is accounted for by means of Conjunction. The Five (Qualities), Sound, Touch, Colour, Savour, and Odour are admitted as evident to the senses. Disjunction and Severalty are resolvable into the Negation of Conjunction. Priority and Posteriority are accountable by particularities of Space and Time. Number, Extension, Fluidity and Viscid- ity are accountable by the very nature of the substances to which they pertain. Gravity is properly resolvable into Force. Hence (the analysis of Non-Substance into) Ten, accords with reason.

THE NON-SUBSTANCE

Amongst these, Pureness, Restlessness and Darkness, the Qualities of Matter, are also (by attribution) Qualities of the Soul. But ex- pressions like: 'Knowledge of the pure sort (satva-rupam jñānam), 'Pure is the time' (sātvikaḥ-kālaḥ) etc., are, on account of accident (upādhi), of a metaphorical description. 

The Five-Sound etc., pertaining to matter, are well known as the Qualities of the Five Elements. The Absolutely Pure Matter of course (as shown in Advent VI) exists in the Eternal Expanse (=Spiritual Universe), and in God who is its Actuator (Will). 

Conjunction and Force are universal (or common) to the Six Substances (note 286).. Such is the distribution.. 

Non-Substance has thus been demonstrated.

The Science of Spirit is concerned with the treatment of Tattva or (Final) Truth, Hita or Means, and Purushärtha or Goal. In this Summary of that Science, an investigation has been made, in the Sections on 'Matter', 'Soul' and 'God' of the Truth; † in the Section on 'Consciousness,' of the Means; in the Section on Eternal Universe' of the Goal. Hence it is clear that all the (Three): 'Truth,' 'Means' and 'Goal' have been dealt with. (Some) sages aver that there is One Truth (Veri- ty or Category). The Ṛshis (Prophets) assert it as Two,-of the divisions Soul and Non-soul. The Acaryas (Teachers) predicate Three, in pursuance of the Šruti (Scriptures) viz., the Enjoyed (matter), the Enjoyer (soul) and Ruler

Other Leaders predicate it as Five- fold: viz., the Goal, the Seeker, the Means, the Fruit, the Bar." Other Guides add Relation and delineate it (Tattva) as Six-fold." Diversity of discussion does not point to diversity in the

"I. E. the disquisition into the nature of the relations subsisting between Matter, Soul and Spirit. Consult work No 10 supra. The relation is parti- cularly that intimate, inalienable and indis- cerptible one subsisting between the Kosmos as the body (Sarira) and Narayana as the Bodied (Šariri), the very connotation of this term being the Spirit (Šariri) enlivening or informing that body (Sarira). All the other relations amongst Godhood, Soulhood etc., are contingent thereon. The relations between God (Spirit) and Soul are grouped under Nine Heads, see Pillai Lokâ-"cārya's Rahasya No. 11: Nava- vidha-sambandha [P: 570, Artha-Pañcaka, JRAS, July 1910].

clear. 

Quintessentially, the purport of the Vedantas is that there is but one Secondless Truth (God) constitutive of the Conscient (Soul) and the Non-Conscient (Matter)—the Brahman. Hence cognising this Conscient-and-Non-Conscient- adjectivated Brahman as the One Unity, the Blessed Badarāyaṇa (i. e. Krshṇa-Dvaipayana- Vyasa) started the inquiry: 

294 

'Now, then, the investigation into Brahman,' and closed it by showing Its (the Unit Brah- man's) qualified (or predicated) nature. 

Therefore, Nārāyaṇa is the Predicated of the Conscient and the Non-Conscient,-designated Brahman,-named Vishnu,-the Supreme Vasu- 

deva. 

What the Tenets (or System) of the School of the Višishta-'dvaitins" are, is thus evident.

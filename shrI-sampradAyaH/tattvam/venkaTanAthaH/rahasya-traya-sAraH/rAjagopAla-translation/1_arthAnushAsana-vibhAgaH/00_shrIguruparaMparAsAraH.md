(With due devotion) we repeat the expression of adoration to our gurus and likewise to their gurus; and among these (latter), we pray for the grace of the  Primaeval Couple (Nārāyaṇa  and Lakṣmī ), the twin śeṣīs[^1] of all the worlds (so that they may be both the end to be attained by us and the means of attaining it).

[^1]: A śeṣa is one who exists solely for the purposes of another. That other is śeṣī .

Having carefully studied the beautiful hymns sung with delight in Tamil by seers,  
we have come to understand the real meaning of the regions of the Upaniṣads which are otherwise difficult to comprehend -  
seers known as Poygai Muni, Bhutamuni, Peyalvar, Kurugesan (Nammalvar) who was born on the banks of the cool Tamraparni, [^2] Viṣṇu cittan, the pure-minded Kulasekhara, our Pananathan, Thondaradippodi, the splendour that appeared in Mazhisai ( Tirumazhisai alvar) and the prince of Maṅgai armed with sword and spear for making bright the path of the Vedas throughout the world.

[^2]: The commentator says that Viṣṇucittan stands for Viṣṇucittan and also for his daughter Andal, the authoress of many hymns.

To those who venture to attain release from the bondage of saṁsāra, the ancient path indicated to us by the spotless Madhurakavi  by his own example is the only safe[^3]  path, for while there is Śrīkṛṣṇa, the great cowherd, who incarnated solely for the sake of his devotees to confer bliss on them, to be their refuge, to be their final goal, to stand in relation to them as mother, father, brother and so on, to change their desire for the pleasures of this world into a desire for Himself, to remove all their sins, to show them infinite compassion, to reveal the truth, and so also to bring about in them a likeness to Himself - while there is Śrīkṛṣṇa ever ready to do all this,[^4] he sought only the feet of the sage Satagopa (Nammālvār) who rendered in Tamil the truths contained in the Vedas which are otherwise hard to understand.

[^3]: safe path: This means Bhakti and Prapatti which lead to mokṣa . Acārya bhakti is called bhakti and prapatti as it leads to them.

[^4]: Madhurakavi in his decade of Tamil verses, says that, to him, Nammalvar is the only God and that through him, he expects to derive all the benefits that men expect to have from God Himself. The path indicated by him is that of devotion to the ācārya for attaining mukti as well as other things.
</details>


THE ĀCĀRYA  ESSENTIAL FOR MOKṢA :

It is said in the Smṛtis: "Kṣatrabandhu[^5] , who was the worst of sinners, and Puṇḍarīka[^6] , the virtuous - both of them obtained mokṣa  or release from bondage by virtue of their having ācāryas." It is thus declared that in the case of every one, the only means of securing mokṣa  is to have an ācārya. To the man desirous of mokṣa , the line of ācāryas is stated in the śruti[^7] to extend upward even to the Supreme Bhagavān for purposes of meditation.

[^5]: Kṣatrabandhu led the life of a highwayman in a forest. He was a source of terror to the sages who lived in that forest. Once when the sage Nārada  happened to pass by him, he rushed at him with his stick. Nārada  took pity on him and asked him to find out from his wife and children whether they would share the sin he was committing, as it was done for their sake. They refused and Kṣatrabandhu realised his folly and begged to be instructed by Nārada  in the truths of religion.

[^6]: Puṇḍarīka was a virtuous Brahmin, who, though he followed the righteous path and went on a pilgrimage to holy places, did not get a vision of God. It was only after being initiated into the Ashtakṣara by Nārada  that he realised God.

[^7]: The śruti  referred to here means - “This line of the ācāryas extends up to Bhagavān thus: This is his ācārya; his ācārya is so and so and so on up to the Lord".

BHAGAVĀN THE FIRST ĀCĀRYA:

The Supreme Lord is the foremost of all ācāryas, as may be seen from the following passages - "Him[^f8] [^f9] (Śrīkṛṣṇa) who is possessed of all excellences, who is the ācārya[^8] , father and guru", "Nārāyaṇa [^f10] who is the guru of all the world is also my guru", "Thou[^f11] art my kinsman, and Thou art my guru", and "Thou art[^f12] the guru of all the worlds and likewise their goal". It is He that, at the beginning, vouchsafed the Vedas to Brahma and when they were stolen, brought them back to him and through him spread their knowledge in the world. It is He that blessed Brahma's sons, Sanatkumāra and others, to understand[^f13] all truths by themselves and to follow the path of renunciation. Through them He revealed the means of attaining salvation. It is Bhagavān who, later by the agency of such great seers as Nārada , Parāśara, Śuka  and Soubaka, maintained intact the tradition of the Upaniṣads. It has been said "Know[^f14] that Vyāsa who is otherwise called Kṛṣṇa Dvaipayana is the Lord Nārāyaṇa  Himself. Who else is there in the world, O Maitreya, that could compose the Mahābhārata ?" It has also been said, “Devoutly[^f15] uttering the name of that great sage (Vyāsa), Bhīṣma said with folded hands ". Into such great men as Vyāsa referred to above the Lord entered and through them published to the world great works like Mahābhārata and Sārīraka Mīmāmsā (Brahma Sūtras). Further in such incarnations as Hamsa, Matsya, Hayagrīva, Nara, Nārāyaṇa , and the Gītācārya (Śrīkṛṣṇa), He himself stood out and revealed spiritual truths and also the means of attaining mokṣa  (tattva and hita). He had His invaluable teaching confirmed also through the words of such men of wisdom as Bhīṣma. It has been said[^f16] Nārāyaṇa  Himself dictated the whole of  the Pāñcarātra", When this Śāstra which was originally taught by Him became lost, once again at the end of the Dvāpara Yuga and the beginning of the Kali Yuga, He[^f17] revealed it again through Saṅkarṣaṇa in accordance with the ordinances of the Sātvatas so that all castes, Brahmins, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, and Śūdras, might, after initiation by the ācārya with the prescribed marks (Śaṅkha and Cakra, worship and render service to the lord in the performance of their daily duties with their minds set on the Eternal. As is said in the following verse, “In the yuga of Kali[^f18] , the Lord Acyuta enters into the respective persons of men already born and carries out His designs", Nārāyaṇa  assumed a new series of ten incarnations in the forms of Parankusa (Nammalvar), Parakala (Tirumaṅgai) and others. In these ten avatars, just as clouds take in the water of the ocean and then pour it down in the form of rain so essential to the life of every one, the Lord gathered together those parts of the Vedas which are most significant and revealed them briefly in a language (Tamil) which is accessible to everyone.

[^8]: Ācārya here means one who teaches Brahma Vidyā and guru one who teaches the Vedas. This verse was spoken by Sahadeva to those assembled at the Rajasuya sacrifice,

When this path of spiritual life was threatened with obstruction by heretics, open and covert, He incarnated again in the land of Agastya in the forms of many teachers of the true doctrine. Has it not been said, “The god,[^f19] Nārāyaṇa , Himself, assumes a mortal form out of compassion and lifts up the world submerged (in the darkness of ignorance) with the śāstras as His hand ", and so also, "Our[^f20] Lord dressed in his yellow raiment came as the guru out of compassion to impart the teaching of the Veda". In reference to this, the Maharshi, Śuka , says, “In the[^f21] yuga of Kali, devotees .of Nārāyaṇa  endowed with spiritual greatness, will be born here and there in large numbers in the land of the Dravidas, where flow the rivers, the Tamraparni, the Vaigai, the Palar, the holy Cauveri and the Mahānadī which runs westwards."

THE SUCCESSION OF VAISHNAVITE ĀCĀRYAS.


Among these ācāryas. Nāthamuni was the son of Iśvaramuni, and he gave us "Nyāya Tatvam"and " Yoga Rahasyam." Since Nāthamuni received the sacred tradition from one of the spiritual descendants of Madhurakavi, and was blessed with spiritual wisdom from a study of Tiruvoymozhi and since, in his yogic contemplation, Nammalvar appeared to him and taught him the sacred lore, his ācārya was Nammalvar himself (though they lived at different times). Nāthamuni's son was Iśvara Bhatta. To Iśvara Bhatta was born Aḷavandār (Yāmunācārya). The works of Aḷavandār are the following eight :-" Āgama Prāmānyam", " Puruṣa Nirnaya", the three Siddhis, namely, “ Ātma Siddhi", "Iśvara Siddhi", "Samvit Siddhi", "ŚrīGitārtha Sangraha", "Stotram" and "The Tetrad of ślokas," Sottai Nambi was the son of Aḷavandār. Sottai Nambi's son was Ennachchan. Ennachchan had four sons, one of whom was Pillayappar. Pillayappar's son was Thozhappar, Thozhappar had two daughters. The chief disciples who sought the feet of Nāthamuni were eight :- Uyyakkoodar, Kurukaikavalappan, Nambi Karunakara Dasar, Erutiruvudaiyar, Thirukkannamaṅgai Andan, Vanamadevi Andan, Uruppattur Achan Pillai and Sokattur Alvan. Uyyakondar had five disciples; they are Manakkal Nambi, Tiruvallikkeni Pan Perumal Araiyar, Settalur Sendalaṅgarar, ŚrīPuṇḍarīka Dasar and Ulagapperumal Naṅgai. The chief disciples of Manakkal Nambi were five; they are Aḷavandār, Deivattukkarasu Nambi, Gomatam Tiruvinnagar  Appan, Siruppulloor Avudaiya Pillai and Acchi. Aḷavandār had fifteen disciples: they are - Peria Nambi, Tirukkottiyar Nambi, Tirumalai Andan, Aḷavandār Alvar, Tirumalai Nambi, Isandan Deivavari Andan, Siriyandan, Tirumohoor Appan, Tirumohoor Ninrar, Deivapperumal, Tirumapgai Aliyar, Pillai Tirumalirunjolai Dasar, Maraner Nambi and Alkondi. Six disciples sought the feet of Perianambi; they were :-- Emperumanar (ŚrīRāmānuja), Malaikuniya Ninrar, Arya ŚrīSatagopa Dasar, Aniaraṅgattamudanar, Tiruvoykulamudaiyan Pattar and Tirukkacchi Nambi. ŚrīRāmānuja learnt the meanings of the rahasyas or mantras at the feet of Tirukkottiyar Nambi. He studied Tiruvoymozhi at the feet of Tirumalai Andan. He learnt Tiruvoymozhi at the feet of Aḷavandār Alvar and learnt also“ Stotram" and the ancient tradition from him. At the feet of Tirumalai Nambi he studied the Rāmāyana. Śrī Rāmānuja's writings are nine in number: Śrī Bhāṣyam, Dīpam, Sāram, Vedartha Sangraham, ŚrīGita Bhāṣyam, Siriya Gadyam (Śrīraṅga Gadyam), Periya Gadyam (Saranāgati Gadyam), Vaikuṇṭha   Gadyam and Nityam. The names of the chief disciples of Rāmānuja may be learnt from the respective tradition of each reader,

BHAKTI TO  ĀCĀRYA ESSENTIAL:

It has been said, "The wise[^f22] man should bring his guru to the light (of renown) and should guard the sacred mantra with great care; from the omission to bring his guru to light and by revealing the mantra, he declines in wealth (of knowledge) and in age (spiritual standing)." His bringing the guru to light and his omission to do so, it needs no saying, are due to the excess or deficiency of his devotion to his guru.

[^f22]: Śeṣasamhita: 14-50

From [^f23] Kaṭha śruti[^9]  and [^f24] Jābala śruti[^10]  it is well-known that all desired knowledge arises from supreme devotion to the guru resembling that to Bhagavān. This is learnt also from the incident of Sañjaya seeing all things as if they occurred before him, as the result of his supreme devotion to his guru Vyāsa. From the episodes of Raikwa (and others) it is evident that the guru who does not reveal spiritual truths immediately even to those śiṣyas who are of excellent character will not be adversely affected in his spiritual life. If, on the other hand, the guru reveals these spiritual truths to any and every disciple in the belief that the śiṣya who has sought him must be good, he will be adversely affected; for, in such cases, it is said that the sins of the disciple become also the sins of the guru This may be seen from the story of Brahma. Without careful enquiry (into his fitness) he revealed truths to Indra. As a consequence Brahma forgot his divine knowledge and had to be taught again by Bhagavān through the agency of Nārada , Brahma's very disciple. In the śloka referred to above, the meaning that, by not bringing the guru to light and by improper bringing of the mantra to light, the man suffers decline respectively in wealth and in age is primarily intended owing to appropriateness and the support of Jabala and Kaṭha śruti s. There is nothing wrong in interpreting the śloka as meaning also "He who omits to bring his guru to light and brings the mantra to light will suffer decline both in wealth (the wealth of spiritual knowledge ) and in age (spiritual standing)." It follows from this that a man should bring his guru to light by way of the overflow of his supreme devotion to him under all conditions and that the sacred mantra should not, for the sake of any material advantage, be revealed to the fickle-minded who do not possess all the qualities prescribed for a disciple. If the mantra is revealed to undeserving persons, its great value which is like that of a casket made of rubies containing a precious jewel will suffer and the guru's spiritual greatness will also be adversely affected. The word guru refers, by implication, to the earlier gurus also in the line of ascent extending up to Bhagavān. Or it may mean gurus in general. Similarly the word mantra refers also to the meanings of the mantra and other secret doctrines connected with it. As a rule or vidhi, it has been laid down that, whenever a man meditates on these secret meanings or mysteries, he should also meditate on the lineal succession of gurus. It has also been said: “As an [^f25] expiation for having conversed with those that are forbidden as unfit (for conversation), we should meditate on the virtuous." By the words " the virtuous ", this śloka refers primarily to the. ācāryas.

[^f25]: Gautama Dharma Sūtra: 9.18

[^9]: Kaṭha śruti : This wisdom concerning the soul cannot be obtained by the mere exercise of reason. Only when it is imparted by another (the guru), does it lead to the knowledge which is the means of attaining mokṣa .Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.II.9

[^10]: Jābāla says in the śruti : "It is only the Vidya or wisdom learnt from an ācārya that gives proficiency Chandogya Upaniṣad: IV-9-3

[^11]: The disputations of these ācāryas are compared to the succession of neighings coming from the God Hayagrīva who is seated in their hearts. By these disputations they are said to have put down the pride of the exponents of rival systems.

We shall come to new life again by bowing every day at the feet of the noble and generous Nāthamuni, who to his (two)[^13] loving disciples who were like a trumpet and a conch (to proclaim the truth and to cow down the exponents of rival systems) taught the art of music so that they might sing the sweet strains of the Tamil Veda which had been long forgotten in the world and who propagated in the world, for the pursuit of all, the path of tapas (bhakti and prapatti). In all the four regions of the world there is no one equal to us (because of this devotion of ours to Nāthamuni).[^14]

[^13]: Two disciples : Kilagathalvan and Melagathalvan

[^14]: There are some who maintain that this chapter on the succession of gurus is not part of Śrīmad Rahasyatrayasāra and that the latter begins only with the "Introductory Chapter", which follows.

इति श्रीकवितार्किकसिंहस्य सर्वसन्त्रस्वतन्त्रस्य  
श्रीमद्वेङ्कटनाथस्य वेदान्ताचार्यस्य कृतिषु  
श्रीमद्रहस्यत्रयसारे  
गुरुपरंपरासारः संपूर्णः ॥  
श्रीमते निगमान्तमहादेशिकाय नमः

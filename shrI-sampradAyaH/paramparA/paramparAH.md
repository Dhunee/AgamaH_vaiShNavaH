### उत्तराधिकारी
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

- Most probable (Vadakalai) view - pillan was named successor.
- Per another tradition parasara bhattar was made leader after ramanuja.
- As per one tradition (Guru-parampara), Ramanuja's cousin Embar succeeded him as the leader of Shrivaishnavas, followed by Parasara Bhattar.

Vijay read an article which made the following points:

- Embar was 8 years younger than Ramanujar making him 113 at the time of Ramanuja's death. According to the  Tirumudi Adaivu of Appillai, Embar lived only until the age of 105 making it impossible for him to succeed Ramanuja.
- Bhattar lived for 28 years (according to Idu, see below) and would have died 47 years before Ramanuja died, and 39 years before Embar died.
- Idu 36000 on Tiruvaymozhi 32.10 says that immediately after explaining this verse to his sons, Kurattazhvan taught the Ashtaksharam to both on grounds that life is short and death is unpredictable. Shortly after, Parasara Bhattar died at age 28.
- It appears unlikely that when both Ramanuja and Kurattazhvan were alive, Parasara Bhattar could have had Embar as acharya.

## समाश्रयणदातारः
- He nominated 74 simhasanadhipathis and ordained them to do pancha samskaram to sishyas at their places.

### आचार्यदीक्षा
समाश्रयण-दातॄणां विशिष्ट-दीक्षा भवतीति केचित्,  
समाश्रयण-प्राप्त्या ऽऽचार्यानुमत्या चालम् इत्य् अन्ये।  
तया व्यक्तिर् वा कुलम् अपि वा ऽऽचार्यपदम् आरोप्यत इति केचित्। 

## भाष्य-प्रचारकाः
- From the 74 simhasanadhipathis, he selected four, gave them the Sri Bhashya kosha and instructed them to do Sri Bhashya pravachanam thereby making them Sri bhashya simhasanadhipathis.

- कुरुगेशः, तिरुक्-कुरुगै-पिऱान्-पिळ्ळन् (श्रीशैल-पूर्णपुत्रः, तातार्यः, R's maternal cousin).
  - Ubhaya Vedanta simhasanadhipati. The oldest (and perhaps only contemporary) text on ramanuja calls pillaan alone as UVS.
  - Essentially nominated successor by rAmAnuja as per ravilochana. 
  - R asked him (presumably stronger in tamiL) to compose bhagavad-viShayam on divyaprabandha. No such commentary existed before piLLan.
- naDAtUr ALvan (रामानुज-भागिनेयः)
- Kidambi Acchaan (प्रणतार्तिहरः, रामानुज-पाचकः). He was specially taught the rahasyas as per vijay.
- Mudali Andan (रामानुज-भागिनेयः).

## वेदान्तदेशिक-शाखा
- **रामानुजः** → आत्रेयः प्रणतार्तिहरः → … → आत्रेय-रामानुजः आपुल्लार् किडाम्बिकुलः → वेदान्तदेशिको **वेङ्कटनाथः** →  तत्पुत्रः कुमारवरदः, परकालयतिः → नडातूरु-वात्स्य-घटिकाशतकः … → अहोबिलाचार्यः → पञ्चमत-भञ्जन-ताताचार्यः … → आत्रेय-गोपालार्यः मुनि-त्रय-सम्प्रदाय-प्रवर्तकः, aka Thirukkudanthai Desika → Ramanuja Maha Desikan (Andavan Ashrama), Annarya, Vangipuram Vedhantha Ramanuja Maha desikan (Aandikadu Swamy in Srirangam)

### ताताचार्याः
A small section of tataryas (mostly belonging to the addanki branch and some belonging to srimushnam branch with a few more here n there) are tenkalais. More than 95% of tataryas must be vdk.

### श्रीभाष्य-परम्परा
- R->Pillaan->Engalazhvan -> Nadadur Ammal (great-grandson of Nadadur Alvan - another Sribhashya simhasanadhipati) -> Kidambi Appullar -> VD


### Andavans 

- Ramanuja Maha Desikan …
- → PeriAndavan(25-2-1801 to 1884-feb) 
- →  Srinivasa Raghavachariar (chinnAndavan-Karthigai Magham) lived from 1828 to 1894 
- → KadanthEthi Andavan Sadhavadhani Varadha Vedanthachar (Avani-Moolam) -(1829 to 1909)

### अहोबिलमठः
<details><summary>आदिमाहोबिलमठाचार्यस्य काले रविलोचनः</summary>

His period should have started about 1458.. 60 yrs (one samvatsara cycle) later than the traditional dates claimed by the matha. That shall also explain how allasani peddanna (who was in krishnarayas durbar) calls him as his acharya among other things - like inscriptions of his successor from 1515 or so CE.

- रामानुज एव विषभिक्षां लेभे श्रीरङ्गे। 
- Of the 4 bhAShya-simhAsanAdipati-s, three left srirangam soon after.
- MudaliyaNDAn seems to have lived there but his descendants were removed from shrIrangam temple management as we see. His descendant, one thozhappar (not the vaidika sarvabhauma) has been shown as a jealous guy in the tenkalai hagiography.

> (Pillan's disciple) Engalazhvan did not have any children. But engalaazhvaan vamsham is there in srirangam. Srirangam guys usurped this and parashara bhatta tirumaligais.
> 
> It has happened so recently as well. Annan tirumaligai did not have anyone in main lineage by the late 1800s or early 1900s. Srirangam sishyas selected some other male member from extended family branch/ sagotra, installed them as adopted son of previous acharya. He was not adopted by the acharya himself. But made his son by sishyas after the vaikuntha prapti of the earlier one.

### कृतिषु व्यावृत्तिः
Acharya-hrdayam was composed by lokAchArya's younger brother. 

> This work was the start of an open revolt against vaidikas among vaishnavas. Eg. "You guys follow Rishi gotras . We belong to azhvaar gotra .."

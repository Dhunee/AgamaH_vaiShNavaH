### उत्तराधिकारी
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

- Most probable (Vadakalai) view - pillan was named successor.
- Per another T tradition parasara bhattar was made leader after ramanuja.
- As per one T tradition (Guru-parampara), Ramanuja's cousin Embar succeeded him as the leader of Shrivaishnavas, followed by Parasara Bhattar.

Vijay read an article which made the following points:

- Embar was 8 years younger than Ramanujar making him 113 at the time of Ramanuja's death. According to the  Tirumudi Adaivu of Appillai, Embar lived only until the age of 105 making it impossible for him to succeed Ramanuja.
- Bhattar lived for 28 years (according to Idu, see below) and would have died 47 years before Ramanuja died, and 39 years before Embar died.
- Idu 36000 on Tiruvaymozhi 32.10 says that immediately after explaining this verse to his sons, Kurattazhvan taught the Ashtaksharam to both on grounds that life is short and death is unpredictable. Shortly after, Parasara Bhattar died at age 28.
- It appears unlikely that when both Ramanuja and Kurattazhvan were alive, Parasara Bhattar could have had Embar as acharya.

## समाश्रयणदातारः
- He nominated 74 simhasanadhipathis and ordained them to do pancha samskaram to sishyas at their places.

### आचार्यदीक्षा
समाश्रयणदातॄणां विशिष्टदीक्षा भवति। तया व्यक्तिर् वा कुलम् अपि वा ऽऽचार्यपदम् आरोप्यत इति केचित्। 

## भाष्य-प्रचारकाः
- From the 74 simhasanadhipathis, he selected four, gave them the Sri Bhashya kosha and instructed them to do Sri Bhashya pravachanam thereby making them Sri bhashya simhasanadhipathis.

- Thirukkurugaip piran Pillan (tAtAchArya's son, R's maternal cousin).
  - Ubhaya Vedanta simhasanadhipati. The oldest (and perhaps only contemporary) text on ramanuja calls pillaan alone as UVS.
  - Essentially nominated successor by rAmAnuja as per ravilochana. 
  - R asked him (presumably stronger in tamiL) to compose bhagavad-viShayam on divyaprabandha. No such commentary existed before piLLan.
- naDAtUr ALvan
- Kidambi Acchaan (प्रणतार्तिहरः). He was specially taught the rahasyas as per vijay.
- Mudali Andan.

## वेदान्तदेशिक-शाखा
- **रामानुजः** → आत्रेयः प्रणतार्तिहरः → … → आत्रेय-रामानुजः आपुल्लार् किडाम्बिकुलः → वेदान्तदेशिको **वेङ्कटनाथः** → तत्पुत्रः कुमारवरदः, परकालयतिः → नडातूरु-वात्स्य-घटिकाशतकः … → अहोबिलाचार्यः → पञ्चमत-भञ्जन-ताताचार्यः … → आत्रेय-गोपालार्यः मुनि-त्रय-सम्प्रदाय-प्रवर्तकः, aka Thirukkudanthai Desika → Ramanuja Maha Desikan (Andavan Ashrama), Annarya, Vangipuram Vedhantha Ramanuja Maha desikan (Aandikadu Swamy in Srirangam)

- Sribhashya Guru Parampara upto VD goes R->Pillaan->Engalazhvan -> Nadadur Ammal (great-grandson of Nadadur Alvan - another Sribhashya simhasanadhipati) -> Kidambi Appullar -> VD

Andavans 

- Ramanuja Maha Desikan …
- → PeriAndavan(25-2-1801 to 1884-feb) 
- →  Srinivasa Raghavachariar (chinnAndavan-Karthigai Magham) lived from 1828 to 1894 
- → KadanthEthi Andavan Sadhavadhani Varadha Vedanthachar (Avani-Moolam) -(1829 to 1909)

- रामानुज एव विषभिक्षां लेभे श्रीरङ्गे। 
- Of the 4 bhAShya-simhAsanAdipati-s, three left srirangam soon after.
- MudaliyaNDAn seems to have lived there but his descendants were removed from shrIrangam temple management as we see. His descendant, one thozhappar (not the vaidika sarvabhauma) has been shown as a jealous guy in the tenkalai hagiography.

> (Pillan's disciple) Engalazhvan did not have any children. But engalaazhvaan vamsham is there in srirangam. Srirangam guys usurped this and parashara bhatta tirumaligais.
> 
> It has happened so recently as well. Annan tirumaligai did not have anyone in main lineage by the late 1800s or early 1900s. Srirangam sishyas selected some other male member from extended family branch/ sagotra, installed them as adopted son of previous acharya. He was not adopted by the acharya himself. But made his son by sishyas after the vaikuntha prapti of the earlier one.

### कृतिषु व्यावृत्तिः
Acharya-hrdayam was composed by lokAchArya's younger brother.

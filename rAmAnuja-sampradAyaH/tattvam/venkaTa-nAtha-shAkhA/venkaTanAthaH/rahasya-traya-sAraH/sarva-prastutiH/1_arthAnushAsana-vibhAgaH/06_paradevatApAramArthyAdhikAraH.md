Those who are not proficient in the śāstra s say that there is only a single self, that all deities (like Indra, Agni and so on) are only one, that the three deities (Brahma, Viṣṇu  and Siva), when properly understood, are alike and of equal rank, that these three deities are only one deity (in three forms) and that the Supreme Deity is other than these three and hold other such (erroneous) views, but those who havediscrimination entertain no regard for these (divergent views). The Upaniṣads, with one voice, and so also Manu, Vyāsa and others, following the Upaniṣads, proclaim that Śrīman Nārāyaṇa  is our Lord who has all (things and beings) for His body, that He (alone) can give mukti and that He is the object of blissful enjoyment for those who have attained mokṣa ,

WHY SHOULD WE DETERMINE WHO THE

SUPREME DEITY IS:

All 'reals' have been classified into matter ( Prakṛti), the individual self and the Supreme Self or Iśvara on the basis of the differences among them pointed out before. (From a knowledge of this classification alone), it is not possible to attain supreme devotion to a single deity to the exclusion of all others, unless the truth as to who is the Supreme Deity has been ascertained as in the words of the Alwar: "She will not worship any god other than Bhagavān nor dream of any such god". Further, to no one but the exclusive devotee of the Supreme Deity, is mokṣa  possible of attainment without delay. So it is necessary to decide who is the Supreme Deity.

CRITICISM OF ERRONEOUS VIEWS:

In this context, the view that all (things and beings) are the substance of Brahman cannot be accepted, since sentient and non-sentient things are known by the pramāṇas.to be entirely different from one another. In the same way, the essential differences between the jīva and Iśvara cannot be ignored (and they disprove the view that they are one). Similarly the mutual differences among the gods are based on the pramaṇas, because of their association with varied pleasures and pains. Therefore, though the indwelling Supreme Self, Antaryāmin is one, the view that Brahma, Rudra, and the other gods are not different from Iśvara and from one another cannot be justified.

BRAHMĀ, RUDRA AND OTHERS ARE

CREATED BEINGS:

Those who are considered as the chief among these gods, namely, Brahma, Rudra, Indra and others are created beings subject to the law of karma, as can be proved by pramāṇas. It has been said, "When [^f173] 'all individual beings and even the aggregate jīva (Samashti) have gone into dissolution and when mahat has become merged into prakṛti (from which it evolved), there is one remaining as the soul of the universe and He is the Lord Nārāyaṇa ." Again it is said, “The [^f174] god Nārāyaṇa  is at the beginning; from Him arises Brahma", "[^f175] Nārāyaṇa  is the Supreme Deity; From Him was born Brahma, the four-faced, and from Brahma arose Rudra, O goddess ", and further, it is stated, "Then you, "[^f176] the irresistible, assumed the form of Viṣṇu from that eternal existence (viz. Nārāyaṇa ) for the protection of all beings." From this it is clear that, by his own will, He incarnated as the middle one (i.e. Viṣṇu ) of the Trinity. He who is expressed by the names, Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa , iş stated to have been the ultimate cause of the world in His previous and original state. It is also said elsewhere, " There is no "[^f177] being in the world that is eternal, either among those that move or among those that do not move, except that one Primaeval Puruṣa called Vāsudeva." This declares that He alone is eternal. Therefore, other views such as the following: "The gods of the trinity (Brahma, Viṣṇu , and Siva), are of equal greatness"; "The three gods of the Trinity are only one", "Iśvara is above and beyond the Trinity" "Either Brahma or Rudra among the Trinity is the Supreme Lord "-these views stating equality, identity, the existence of an entity superior to all the three of the Trinity and the supremacy of a different member of the Trinity, are against the pramāṇas. That Brahma, Rudra, and the like are created beings subject to karma may be seen in the following passages :-" The [^f178] purusha or person created by Him (Nārāyaṇa ) is called Brahma in the world". "Having [^f179] caused the dissolution of the worlds before, you lay on the waters of the great ocean and created me at first by your Māya (will)", " Brahma's name [^f180] is Ka and I, Isa rule over all embodied beings. We two were born from your limbs. Therefore you are called Keśava (Ka and Isa)". Further Brahma says, "I was [^f181] born from His graciousness for some reason and you, from His wrath, for some other reason, in one of the earlier creations." The very words of these rival gods, which are, so to say, a deed of release written with their own hands, declare this truth. That Brahma and Rudra are subject to karma and attained their high status, because of having worshipped the Lord of all with special rites, may be seen from the following passages : -- "All the [^f182] gods sacrifice to Vāsudeva and all the gods bow to Vāsudeva." "Brahma, [^f183] Rudra and Indra, together with all other gods and the great rishis worship the divine Nārāyaṇa  or Hari, the greatest of Gods ", " Meditating [^f184] constantly on the

Lord, Brahma, Isana (Rudra) and others have not yet attained to a realisation of His nature. It is He whose protection I seek." And Brahma says :- " Having [^f185] created me in the divine lotus in your navel shining like the sun, you have assigned to me all the duties of creation (of Prajāpati) and with this burden imposed on me, I worship you, the Lord of the Universe." And in another place, we find the following :- "Brahma, [^f186] born of the lotus, having worshipped Viṣṇu for thousands of crores of yugas, obtained again the position of the creator of the three worlds. This is what we have heard." So also it is said :-" [^f187] Mahadeva (Rudra), who is called Viswarupa, sacrificed all things in a great yajna called Sarvamedha and then sacrificed himself also mentally", "Mahadeva sacrificed himself in the Sarvamedha and became the god of gods. The [^f188] resplendent Rudra, clad in the skin of the elephant, reaches all the worlds with his knowledge and shines with his fame". "Since in this [^f189] great sacrifice, he gave me my share of the offering, he has been authorised by me, in the Vedas and the Sūtras, as fit to receive his share of the offerings." These gods, Brahma, Rudra and others are dependent upon the Maya of Bhagavān ((i.e.) Prakṛti) and are subject to the influence of the gunas (sattvam, rajas and tamas). Their knowledge is also subject to contraction and expansion. All this may be understood from the incidents of the loss of the Vedas and others and also from the following śloka  :-"All the [^f190] gods beginning with Brahma, all men, and all animals are enveloped by the dense darkness of delusion arising from the whirlwind of Viṣṇu 's Maya (Prakṛti)," "The wise say that [^f191] these (positions) are the rewards of those who follow the good path of Satva, namely, Brahma and the other creators, and the deities presiding over karma, mahat and avyaktam"

THE OTHER GODS ARE THE SERVANTS

OF BHAGAVĀN.

That these (Brahma and Rudra) render service to the Lord, who is their inner self, with the help of the knowledge given to them by Him may be seen from the following śloka  : "These two[^f192] , who are the greatest among the gods, are considered to have been born (respectively) out of His (Bhagavān's) graciousness and wrath; and they perform the duties of creation and destruction in accordance with the lines laid down by Him." They are not pure and are not objects for spiritual meditation (subhasraya), for it has been said: "Bhagavān [^f193] Hiranyagarbha (Brahma), Vasava (Indra) and Prajāpati ... ... ... all these gods and others are impure, their births being due to past karma" and again, "From Brahma[^f194] to the blade of grass, all beings that have their existence in the world have had their births as the result of karma and are subject to the cycle of births and deaths ( saṁsāra)" and further, “The [^f195] man who has no attachment (to the things of this world) should know that every being including Brahma is impure as being tainted by the ripening of karma -- to Him, Vāsudeva alone is the Supreme Goal or refuge." These statements have been made by Parāśara, Śaunaka, Śuka  and others. Brahma, Rudra and others have to seek Bhagavān's protection and Bhagavān has to seek nobody else's protection. This is clear from His own words :"The gods[^f196] are under the protection of Rudra, O King, and Rudra is under the protection of Brahma. Brahma is under my protection and I do not seek the protection of any one. There is no one that I need for my protection, for I am the refuge of all." These gods are among the great possessions (vibhūti) of Bhagavān, who is the Lord of both lilāvibhūti and nitya-vibhūti,) --- for it is said, “Brahma[^f197] Dakṣa and others, Kala, Rudra and the destroyer of Kala - all these are among the vibhūtis of Bhagavān," where Brahma and Rudra are spoken of as being on the same footing as Dakṣa and others.

[^f197]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-22-33

THE OTHER GODS ARE THE PRAKĀRAS OR

MODES OF BHAGAVĀN.

These gods (Brahma, Rudra etc.) are, like others, the modes or prakāras of the Lord of all who has all things as His body. This is clear from the grammatical apposition or co-ordination (sāmānādhikaranya) in which they are used, just like other substances, in connection with such words as Nārāyaṇa . (For example it is said that Rudra is Nārāyaṇa , Brahma is Nārāyaṇa , the earth is Nārāyaṇa  and so on.)

That these are His bodies and that He is their inner self or goal is evident from these words of Brahma to Rudra :- "He is [^f198] the inner self of you, of me and of all those who are called embodied beings. He sees all but cannot be apprehended by any one, anywhere." These are śeṣas who exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and He is their śeṣī. This truth was expressed by the all-knowing Rudra himself in Mantrarājapadastotra, where he says, "All beings are, by their nature, the servants of the Supreme Self. Therefore I am also Thy servant and, with this knowledge, I bow to Thee."

[^f198]: Mahābhārata: Śāntiparva 361-4

BHAGAVĀN HAS NEITHER EQUALS NOR SUPERIORS :

Thus Nārāyaṇa  is destitute, in every way, of equals and superiors. This may be seen from the following śloka s :- "O best [^f199] of men, there is no one superior to (Nārāyaṇa)   the god of the lotus-like eyes;" "There was[^f200] no one superior to Him in the past nor will there be any one superior to Him in the future : “There is no[^f201] god superior to Viṣṇu , O best of kings; " "There is nothing[^f202] more auspicious than Vāsudeva, there is nothing more purifying than Vāsudeva. There is no greater divinity than Vāsudeva. No one who adores Vāsudeva ever perishes." "In all [^f203] the three worlds, there was no one like Him ever born and there will be no one like Him born in the future." " There[^f204] is no divinity higher than Keśava." "He is the [^f205] King of all kings, Viṣṇu , the great Brahman. We know Him to be Iśvara. He is the Father, the Creator." Those who are lucky, even while in their mother's womb and have received, while in the state of being born, the glance of Madhusūdana will become desirous of mokṣa ; for His glance dispels rajas and tamas. Those who are looked at by Brahma and Rudra just before birth will become subject to the influence of rajas and tamas. This difference is brought out in the following passages - "He who[^f206] is looked at by Madhusūdana just as he is being born should be considered to be a pure soul (sātvika) and he will ever think of the goal of mokṣa . Jf, on the other hand, a person is looked at immediately at birth by Brahma or Rudra, his mind will be overcome by rajas and tamas."

THE ASPIRANT FOR MUKTI SHOULD WORSHIP

ONLY BHAGAVĀN.

That these gods are not to be worshipped by those who desire mokṣa  (and that Nārāyaṇa , the Lord of all, who is the cause of these gods, is alone the deity to be worshipped by all those who desire mokṣa , including these gods) may be seen from the following śloka s :- "To those[^f207] who are sunk in the sea of saṁsāra and whose minds are overpowered by the objects of sense pleasures, there is no other refuge than the ship of Viṣṇu ," "Those who [^f208] have a discriminating intelligence never worship Brahma, or Rudra or any of the other gods, for the fruit of their worship is very limited,” “Hari alone[^f209] is fit to be meditated upon, O Brabmins, by you who are noted for your sattvam. He is always to be adored and I am the means for enabling you to remember Hari.” If, in some places, these gods are spoken of as assisting in the attainment of mokṣa , it should be understood to mean that they, like ācārya s, assist by imparting knowledge and in such other ways. This is also the purport of the following passage ; " The man[^f210] who is a devotee of the god of the sun (Surya) will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Rudra by the Sun's grace. He who is a devotee of Saṅkara will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Viṣṇu  by the grace of Saṅkara." And again :--- "He who is a devotee of Vāsudeva will, after those seven births, become one with Vāsudeva by His grace." In this context it has to be stated that devotion to Surya and others leads gradually to devotion to Bhagavān, only in the case of those who are not subject to mental delusions about the Supreme Self and the Self's that are below it - such delusions as holding that they are all one or that the lower self is the Supreme Self or that all these divinities are of equal power, and provided they are not filled with the hatred natural to the asuric or demoniac Nature. This is evident from the śloka  : "Those who[^f211] hold Parushottama as being similar to the other deities are to be considered heretics unfit for any kind of karma or rite." People who have such delusions in their knowledge (and worship) will meet with defeat due to the punishment inflicted by Bhagavān, although they have devotion to other deities. From the following śloka  : "O mighty Rudra[^f212] , get Śāstras of deluding import composed and by prompting men to slight effort, show the fruit of these actions as soon as possible"-from this śloka , we may infer that, if there is success in achieving taṅgīble fruits by following these false śāstra s, it is only for making men fall into delusion and thence into hell.

If Bhagavān, whose will is irresistible, decides that some one deserves His punishment, then that person will find no other god capable of protecting him. It is said in the Rāmāyana " If a man has [^f213] deserved death at the hands of Rāma, neither the four-faced Brahma, who was born of no mortal, nor the three-eyed Rudra who destroyed Tripura, nor the great Indra, who is the leader of the gods, will be able to shield him in battle." If, on the other hand, a man seeks refuge under Bhagavān, even if all the gods and intimate friends of His, like Sugrīva, the great king, propose to injure him, Iśvara will protect him by overcoming wicked men like Ravana who should be overcome, and helping, by persuasion, such good people as the leaders of the monkeys who bad spoken against Vibhishana, as they deserve that course. For has he not said :-"To him who[^f214] has sought my protection even once and begged of me saying, "I am thine" -- to him I afford protection from all beings. This is my vow" and is He not one who ever keeps his word and sees that His vows do not fail ?

[^f214]: Rāmāyaṇa:Yuddhakāṇḍa: 18-33

THE BOONS GRANTED BY OTHER DEITIES ARE

DEPENDENT ON THE GRACE OF BHAGAVĀN.

If men seek the favour of other gods, they will soon obtain minor rewards which are like poison mixed with honey, for it is said, “Those [^f215] who desire the fruits of karma or rites perform sacrifices to the gods and obtain the rewards of their actions in the world of men very soon." And again :- " From them[^f216] they obtain the objects of their desire as ordained by myself". The Lord said to the gods :-- "This Brahma[^f217] is your father and mother and grandfather, and will, under instructions from me, grant boons to all beings, and Rudra, his younger brother, who had his origin in my forehead, will, under instructions from Brahma, grant boons to all beings" As stated in these passages, these are dependent upon Bhagavān. It is said :-- "The rewards[^f218] (obtained from these deities) are of a very limited nature; " " In kalpas[^f219] or ages when sattva is predominant, Hari's glory becomes great and, only in them, those who have successfully practised yoga in accordance with the śāstras will attain the supreme goal." Therefore, from these other deities, mokṣa  cannot be attained even after a length of time. From the Lord of all, on the other hand, a man obtains unsurpassed wealth and the like, even as [^f220] Brahma attained his high position after worshipping Viṣṇu  for crores of thousands of yugas; and afterwards, like the man who bathes in the Gaṅga for physical refreshment and thereby obtains purification also from all his sins, he gets incidentally freedom from sins; his rajas and tamas decline and his sattvam becomes dominant and, in course of time, he will attain mokṣa  like Janaka, Ambarisha, Kekaya and others. But there is delay in such cases as may be seen in the following passages : "At the [^f221] end of many virtuous lives, the man attains spiritual wisdom and seeks my protection” and again, " Those [^f222] who have attained success in crores of births will at length become well established here." "Those who[^f223] have, in many thousands of lives, become purified of their sins by penance, meditation and yoga (samadhi) will acquire devotion to Kṛṣṇa," When the desire for mokṣa  has become ardent and when the man practises  upāya which is within his power, there will be no delay in the attainment of mokṣa , for He has declared:[^f224] "To those who have fixed their minds on me - to them I become the redeemer and save them quickly out of the sea of saṁsāra". To him who adopts prapatti as the independent means, there is neither delay nor absence of delay, except in accordance with his own desire These distinctions will be accepted by all who have regard for the pramāṇas and they have their effect by the will of Iśvara which cannot be questioned, for has it not been said, " The [^f225] lordship of Iśvara is absolutely independent and brooks no questioning ?" To those who do not clearly understand these principles in this way, the worship of other deities is prescribed in such passages as the following: "They may [^f226] be worshipped by men other than those who have discriminating intelligence,"

Those who worship these other deities without knowing that they are the bodies of Bhagavān are like a follower of Charvaka (a materialist who believes that there is nothing other than the body called the soul) who anoints the body of the king, his master, without knowing that his master has a soul. It is true that the soul of the king is pleased with the service done to his body. In the same way, as a matter of fact, the devotion to these other deities is really the worship of Bhagavān, as they are only His bodies. Notwithstanding this, the fruit of this devotion to the lower deities would be only partial and incomplete. (We may remember in this connection the śloka  in the Gita) which says:- " Those [^f227] who sacrifice with faith and earnestness to other deities -- they, too, sacrifice only to me, but not in the manner and according to the rules prescribed for it." Since the rite is performed in an irregular manner without the observance of all the rules, the fruit will be partial and incomplete, If, on the other hand, a man, knowing that these other gods are only the bodies of Bhagavān, offers worship to them owing to a special desire for obtaining quickly the smaller goods of life, the fruit will be fully and completely realised in perfect measure.

[^f227]: Bhagavadgītā: 9-23

The Gita thus speaks of those who approach Bhagavān for minor fruits :-" The man[^f228] who has lost his wealth but seeks to recover it, the man who wants to enjoy his own soul, and the man who wants to acquire prosperity” All these will have their reward in even greater measure." Of those who adore Bhagavān without any such desire for minor fruits and only for the sake of mokṣa , it is said, "Hari[^f229] , who confers mokṣa , gives to His worshippers who meditate on Him, health of body, wealth, and enjoyment, in addition to what they desire viz., mokṣa ". These are, so to say, adventitious or incidental rewards (ānushaṅgīka ) not sought by them. Śrī Kulasekhara Perumal, to whom such adventitious prosperity was vouchsafed, says in this connection:-"The man[^f230] who desires only Thee and does not seek great prosperity -  prosperity comes and seeks him." Isandan also has stated this in his stotra thus "Those enjoyments which were formerly desired but could not be obtained come to us, of their own accord, without any effort or exertion on our part, like rivers flowing into the ocean, (although we do not desire them now)." (It may be asked why all those who desire only mokṣa  are not blessed with the good things of this life ). (The answer is):- This is due to the special form of meditation or vidyā practised by the devotee and the special desires of his earlier life. (Some vidyās secure worldly prosperity in addition to mokṣa  after death, while others secure only mokṣa .)

The Alwars, too, have spoken of these differences between the Lord of all on one side and Brahma, Rudra and the other gods on the other side, in passages such as the following: “The gods[^f231] are only the food eaten by Bhagavān and vomited afterwards, (eaten during pralaya and vomited after creation); are there any (gods) who are not of the nature of this vomit?" "Nārāyaṇa[^f232] created the god with four faces, and the god with four faces created Saṅkara." "O Thou[^f233] that art the original bulb of the lotus of the navel, from which arose Brahma, Siva, Indra and the others who worship you with reverence.” “ Arjuna[^f234] saw on Siva's head, the flowers of the garland that he had placed at the feet of the holy Bhagavān which had measured the whole world, and understood clearly that Śrīkṛṣṇa was the Supreme Deity wearing garland of green tulasi." "Indra[^f235] who rules over the gods, Brahma the god with four faces, and the great Siva with his matted locks of hair - (all these) meditate with earnestness and

sincerity on His lotus-like feet and go about praising Him." "He alone[^f236] is the Lord of Siva who is spoken of in high terms, of Brahma and of all others." "O Lord[^f237] whose glory cannot be adequately understood even by him who rides on the unique bull and by Brahma," And again, "[^f238] Neither the god who has the ball for his banner, viz. Siva nor Brahma, nor Indra nor any other knows the remedy for the disease called ''birth" (i.e.) saṁsāra."

This truth about Bhagavān being the Supreme Deity should be considered as present in the first letter a of aum inTirumantraand in the word Nārāyaṇa therein and in the word Nārāyaṇa  occurring in Dvayam along with its attribute Śrīman (along with Śrī or Lakṣmī ) and likewise in the words 'me' and 'I' occurring in the Carama Śloka.

For men other than those who have this conviction about the Supreme Deity, it is not possible to be in the state of having Bhagavān alone exclusively as their protector, a state such as is described in the following and other words of the Alwars: "[^f239] There is no refuge other than Kṛṣṇa". "Whether you[^f240]  weed out my suffering or whether you do not weed it out, I have no other means of getting it removed." "I know[^f241] of no other staff of support for my soul". (We may see also) the ten stanzas beginning with: “If you do not [^f242] withhold the suffering due to my karma", The Alwar[^f243] who learnt all spiritual truths directly from the Lord of all discerned the truth about the Supreme Deity in Tirumantra, gave up all devotion to other deities and became well established in exclusive devotion to Bhagavān, which extends to His devotees and also in rendering exclusive service to the Lord and His devotees. He gives expression to this in the following verse. "I cannot [^f244] live in agreement with those who hold that there is any other deity (than the Lord); I have also obtained the privilege of rendering service to Thy devotees." In the verse beginning with "The earth, water, fire, air, ether--having created these," the Alwar places (before himself) the three gods concerned in this controversy and, after a consideration of pramāṇas, ignores two of them and decides on the remaining deity who is Supreme Light[^f245] "as His god having a complexion resembling that of a cloud." Periāḻvār also declares in the following verse that the deity who is of this form and complexion is the Supreme Reality (Tattva) described in all the Vedas ; "If "you [^f246] meditate on the god who is of the colour of the ocean by uttering the origin of all Veda, namely, the syllable aum with three mātras (metrical units) etc. etc."

Having in mind the passage in Taittiriya which describes the Supreme Deity as being the Lord of Lakṣmī , the Alwar understands that this description excludes other gods and exclaims:-"I have [^f247] seen Lakṣmī  and the form of the Lord shining like gold on which she rests." Beginning with this verse he concludes with the statement that " for wise men it is only Bhagavān who ever acts in conjunction with Lakṣmī  that is both refuge and goal." This he declares in the following verse :- "Our refuge[^f248] is the goddess residing in the beautiful lotus covered with honey, who has long eyes and shines with a splendour which throws into the shade the lightning seated in the black cloud and who fascinates (with her beauty) the God armed with the discus and wearing the garland of tulasi on his broad chest." The conclusion has been arrived at that this couple (Bhagavān and Śrī) are our goal of attainment and our refuge.

This truth regarding the Supreme Deity was taught at great length by the great sage, Parāśara, to his worthy disciple who was fit to receive the great spiritual secrets, in the following śloka  -

“Io all beings,[^f249] gods, men and animals, all that is masculine is Bhagavān, Hari, and all that is feminine is Lakṣmī, O Maitreya, and there is no one other than they," This sage, Parāśara, obtained the knowledge concerning the Supreme Deity by the grace of Pulastya and Vasiṣṭa who gave him this boon :-"You will[^f250] understand the truth about the Supreme Deity." "What Was[^f251] said to you by Pulastya will certainly become true." Our great ācārya , ŚrīYamunamuni, also speaks of Parāśara with the greatest regard in 'I bow to Parāśara[^f252] the best of sages." And Nammāḻvār, who received the gift of knowledge free from all delusion and bhakti from Bhagavān and who occupies the highest place in the line of those who have performed prapatti, has stated the same truth (namely, that Lakṣmī  should also be considered along with Bhagavān as our refuge and our goal): "You have[^f253] enabled me to have a vision of Thyself and Thy consort (Lakṣmī ) with the shining bracelets, standing together."

We have already stated all that should be said in this connection in our commentary on The Four śloka s (of Yāmunācārya) with a refutation of the views of opponents and refer the reader to the same.

Our ācārya s have proclaimed, in so uncertain terms, that our eternal Lord with His Consort seated on the lotus is the Supreme Deity, so that disputants, proud of their knowledge of reasoning and argumentation, may not, each according to his own will, declare that the ultimate cause is this or that (Brahma, Rudra or Indra) thus causing dread to the Vedas[^41] * and trepidation to all devotees.

In this world which is enveloped in avidyā or karma, there may be found, here and there, a single individual who has closely studied Vedānta  and who can realise that Nārāyaṇa with His consort Śrī is the only refuge, when rulers sitting on victorious thrones as sovereigns of countries, of the whole world, and of Brahmanda itself perish utterly along with the story of their lives.
